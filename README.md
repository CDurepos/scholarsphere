## Task Distribution

### D1 - Recorded Video Demonstration
1. ___: Show the database running from scratch (creation, data loading, constraints in action). **deadline**: TBD
2. Aidan, ___: Discuss stored procedures, functions, queries, triggers, and indexing. **deadline**: 11/15 
3. ___: Show at least one example of data scraping and cleaning results. **deadline**: TBD

### D2 - MySQL Database Schema Scripts
Each member will create tables and indexes with comments for their designated tables:

2. Abby:  Instutions & Equipment [`institutions`, `works_at`, `equipment`]. **deadline**: TBD
   
3. Owen:  Publications & Authorship [`publications`, `publication_authors`, `keywords`, `publication_keywords`]. **deadline**: TBD
   
4. Clayton:  Topics & Funding [`user_keywords`, `grants`, `grant_providers`, `grant_recipients`]. **deadline**: TBD

### D3 - Stored Procedures and Functions

### D4 - Data Scraping Scripts and Documentation
Each member will do the following for their designated Maine University: 
1. Provide scraping source code in python.
2. Document source websites, sample outputs, and cleaning steps.
3. Save scraping results in a .csv or .json file with MySQL import compatible formatting.

Designated Universities:
- Aidan:   UMO,  **deadline**: 11/5
- Owen:    UMA,  **deadline**: TBD
- Abby:    USM,  **deadline**: TBD
- Clayton: UMF,  **deadline**: TBD

### D5 - Sample Data and Data Cleaning Documentation

2. Abby:  Instutions & Equipment [`institutions`, `works_at`, `equipment`]. **deadline**: TBD
   
3. Owen:  Publications & Authorship [`publications`, `publication_authors`, `keywords`, `publication_keywords`]. **deadline**: TBD
   
4. Clayton:  Topics & Funding [`user_keywords`, `grants`, `grant_providers`, `grant_recipients`]. **deadline**: TBD

### D6 - Query Optimization Analysis
Each member will provide before/after query performance results for a query on their designated tables and give justification on indexing strategies.
