We examined the effects of simple shear flow on swimming trajectories and orientations of two species of dinoflagellates Glenodinium foliaceum and Alexandrium catenella. In the absence of either shear or a cue that can cause directional motion, swimming orientations of both species were insignificantly different from random. Although cells of G. foliaceum maintained their random swimming orientations upon exposure to shear, swimming orientations of both single cells and chains of A. catenella were affected by shear. Magnitude of the effect increased with shear rate. Changes in decorrelation times, as a result of exposure to shear, were observed for both species, providing another indication that shear affects swimming behavior. Decorrelation times for the swimming directions of both species were of the same order as the characteristic time scale of turbulence that would produce shear rates comparable to those examined in this study. Theoretical models that assess the effects of turbulence on vertical migration of dinoflagellates and predator‐prey interactions commonly assume that swimming motion of dinoflagellates in the presence of shear flow can be described by simple superposition of the flow on the swimming motion in the absence of flow. Our results suggest that this assumption is not universally true.", "year": 2010, "citation_count": 72, "publisher": "Wiley"}

Of particular interest is the motion of diatom chains because they are expected to benefit most from enhancement of nutrient flux due to turbulence and are often the most abundant components in aggregates. We studied the motion of two chain‐forming diatoms, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira nordenskiiildii, in steady shear flow and in the light of available theory for rigid, elongated spheroids. Both species underwent periodic rotation upon exposure to a simple shear flow, as predicted by theory. Whereas the rotational orbits of S. costutum resembled those predicted by theory for rigid spheroids, the rotational motion of T. nordenskiiildii was more like the motion of flexible fibers observed in engineering applications. Periods of rotation of S. costutum increased linearly with increasing axis ratio, whereas no clear relationship was observed between periods of rotation and axis ratios for T. nordenskiiildii. Measured periods of rotation of both species were smaller than predicted by theory for rigid spheroids of similar axis ratios. The diverse behaviors observed imply that fluxes of nutrients and collision frequencies experienced vary greatly with detailed shapes and mechanical properties of chains and their unit cells.", "year": 2010, "citation_count": 61, "publisher": "Wiley"}

The contribution of this research is a framework for the visualization and exploration of spatial, temporal, and thematic dimensions of sensor-based data. The unit of analysis is an event, a spatio-temporal data type extracted from sensor data. The conceptual framework suggests an approach for design layout that can be flexibly modified to explore spatial and temporal trends, temporal relationships among events, periodic temporal patterns, the timing of irregularly repeating events, event–event relationships in terms of thematic attributes, and event patterns at different spatial and temporal granularities. Flexible assignment of spatial, temporal, and thematic categories to a set of graphical interface elements that can be easily rearranged provides exploratory power as well as a generalizable design layout structure. The framework is illustrated with events extracted from Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System data but the approach has broad application to other domains and applications in which time, space, and attributes need to be considered in conjunction.

The observing system in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) is one of the most comprehensive and operational of the Integrated Ocean Observing Systems (IOOS) systems that have been established in the United States to date. It has also been a very successful system, with data returns routinely in the 85-95% range.The Gulf of Maine is a harsh operational environment. Winter storms pose severe challenges, including high waves and the build-up of sea ice on buoy sensors, superstructure, and solar panels, and in summer its productive waters present severe biofouling problems that can affect the optical sensors. The periods of most difficult field operations often coincide with periods of greatest data value in terms of marine safety, search and rescue, and monitoring biological productivity.The challenges of the Gulf of Maine physical environment were paired with the unexpected challenges of the funding environment that have been the hallmark of the turn of this century. Funding for the system has been chronically short and subject to the unpredictable fluctuations of the congressional appropriations process. The inadequacy and variability of funding has substantially hampered the operations of many of the Integrated Ocean Observing Systems, including GoMOOS, and has hindered technological advancements and maintenance measures. As a result, the design of the GoMOOS infrastructure is little improved from that developed almost a decade ago, and it has deteriorated with age, usage, and suboptimal replacement schedules. In the absence of an adequate and reliable funding stream, the system is fast approaching the end of its expected operational lifetime. Unless this trend is reversed, the system will no longer well serve the many citizens, organizations, and agencies that have come to rely on the data it provides.In this article, we present lessons learned by the scientific and technical groups that have been responsible for the data acquisition of GoMOOS. We believe that these lessons are generic, rather than peculiar to the GoMOOS system, and that they have value for others who are embarking on similar endeavors. However, it is important to make clear that these lessons are from the perspective of the scientists, and that the views of others involved in complementary aspects of GoMOOS, including public outreach, fundraising, and providing data and products to the more general user community, are not represented here.", "year": 2009, "citation_count": 9, "publisher": "Marine Technology Society"}

Here, we combined the benefits of seabed mapping, georeferenced trap arrays, and conventional tagging methods to quantify the effect of substrate on movements of the American lobster ( Homarus americanus ). In total, 21 848 lobsters were tagged, and movements were tracked among spatially referenced research and commercial traps. We found that lobster densities from diver surveys were highest on rocky habitat, but catch rates in traps were highest on unstructured sediment, resulting in traps on level bottom having a larger effective fishing area than traps on structurally complex habitat. Moreover, tag returns indicated that lobsters initially caught and released on sediment moved farther and faster than those initially caught in traps on rocky substrate. These observations are consistent with previous reports of the existence of a dichotomy of transient and resident lobsters in coastal populations, but the association of movement with habitat type was unknown. Our results indicate that field studies integrating conventional trapping, visual census, and tagging with seabed mapping can efficiently generate high-resolution information on habitat-related behavior of large samples of benthic organisms.

The population structure of deep-sea red crab (Chaceon quinquedens) in a nearly unexploited state is compared with its condition three decades later after more than a decade of sustained harvesting. Our study is based on a camera and net trawl survey conducted in 1974, which we repeated between 2003 and 2005 on the southern New England shelf break. Although the overall biomass of red crabs was estimated to be higher than in 1974, the abundance of large males, which are targeted by the fishery, was considerably lower. In particular, the biomass of large males (≥114 mm carapace width), considered in 1974 to be marketable, declined by 42%. Declines were most evident at depths and regions most accessible to the fishing fleet based in southern New England. With the change in fishery selectivity towards smaller male crabs, the abundance of currently harvestable crabs is about equal to 1974 levels. No declines were observed in the biomass of female and smaller male crabs not targeted by the fishery. Indeed, the abundance of juveniles appears considerably higher than in 1974. Perhaps, adverse effects on reproduction attributable to a reduction in the numbers of large males may be a consequence of fishing, but fishery impacts and productivity are difficult to assess because key biological information is lacking.", "year": 2008, "citation_count": 18, "publisher": "Oxford University Press (OUP)"}

Our results demonstrate that securinine significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the nitric oxide production in microglia and astrocytic cultures. In addition, securinine inhibited the activation of the inflammatory mediator NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated BV2 cells. Additionally, securinine also inhibited interferon-γ- (IFN-γ-) induced nitric oxide levels and iNOS mRNA expression.

Inhibition of glial activation and inflammatory processes may represent a therapeutic target to alleviate neurodegeneration. Securinine, a major natural alkaloid product from the root of the plant Securinega suffruticosa, has been reported to have potent biological activity and is used in the treatment of neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, poliomyelitis, and multiple sclerosis. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms of neuroprotection elicited by securinine, particularly its anti-inflammatory effects in glial cells. Our results demonstrate that securinine significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the nitric oxide production in microglia and astrocytic cultures. In addition, securinine inhibited the activation of the inflammatory mediator NF-κB, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated BV2 cells. Additionally, securinine also inhibited interferon-γ- (IFN-γ-) induced nitric oxide levels and iNOS mRNA expression.

By harnessing these disparities through derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from the BXD mouse genetic reference panel, along with C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) parental strains, we demonstrate genetically determined biases in lineage commitment and identify major regulators of the pluripotency epigenome. Upon transition to formative pluripotency using epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), B6 quickly dissolves naïve networks adopting gene expression modules indicative of neuroectoderm lineages; whereas D2 retains aspects of naïve pluripotency with little bias in differentiation. Genetic mapping identifies 6 majortrans-acting loci co-regulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression in ESCs and EpiLCs, indicating a common regulatory system impacting cell state transition. These loci distally modulate occupancy of pluripotency factors, including TRIM28, P300, and POU5F1, at hundreds of regulatory elements. Onetrans-acting locus on Chr 12 primarily impacts chromatin accessibility in ESCs; while in EpiLCs the same locus subsequently influences gene expression, suggesting early chromatin priming. Consequently, the distal gene targets of this locus are enriched for neurogenesis genes and were more highly expressed when cells carried B6 haplotypes at this Chr 12 locus, supporting genetic regulation of biases in cell fate. Spontaneous formation of embryoid bodies validated this with B6 showing a propensity towards neuroectoderm differentiation and D2 towards definitive endoderm, confirming the fundamental importance of genetic variation influencing cell fate decisions.", "year": 2021, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"}

These chromosome rearrangements are mediated by the repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as genetic crossovers between parental homologs. In mice, humans, and many other mammals, meiotic DSBs occur primarily at hotspots, determined by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM9 protein. Without PRDM9, meiotic DSBs occur near gene promoters and other functional sites. Studies in a limited number of mouse strains showed that functional PRDM9 is required to complete meiosis, but despite its apparent importance, Prdm9 has been repeatedly lost across many animal lineages. Both the reason for mouse sterility in the absence of PRDM9 and the mechanism by which Prdm9 can be lost remain unclear. Here, we explore whether mice can tolerate the loss of Prdm9. By generating Prdm9 functional knockouts in an array of genetic backgrounds, we observe a wide range of fertility phenotypes and ultimately demonstrate that PRDM9 is not required for completion of male meiosis. Although DSBs still form at a common subset of functional sites in all mice lacking PRDM9, meiotic outcomes differ substantially. We speculate that DSBs at functional sites are difficult to repair as a crossover and that by increasing the efficiency of crossover formation at these sites, genetic modifiers of recombination rates can allow for meiotic progression.

Although a variety of writers, readers, and erasers of epigenetic features are known, we have little information about the underlying regulatory systems controlling the establishment and maintenance of these features. Here, we have explored how natural genetic variation affects the epigenome in mice. Studying levels of H3K4me3, a histone modification at sites such as promoters, enhancers, and recombination hotspots, we found tissue-specific trans-regulation of H3K4me3 levels in four highly diverse cell types: male germ cells, embryonic stem cells, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes. To identify the genetic loci involved, we measured H3K4me3 levels in male germ cells in a mapping population of 59 BXD recombinant inbred lines. We found extensive trans-regulation of H3K4me3 peaks, including six major histone quantitative trait loci (QTL). These chromatin regulatory loci act dominantly to suppress H3K4me3, which at hotspots reduces the likelihood of subsequent DNA double-strand breaks. QTL locations do not correspond with genes encoding enzymes known to metabolize chromatin features. Instead their locations match clusters of zinc finger genes, making these possible candidates that explain the dominant suppression of H3K4me3.

As the prevalence of diabetes grows, so will HF unless the mechanisms connecting these diseases can be identified. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a glycolysis by-product that forms irreversible modifications on lysine and arginine, called glycation. We previously found that myofilament MG glycation causes sarcomere contractile dysfunction and is increased in patients with diabetes and HF. The aim of this study was to discover the molecular mechanisms by which MG glycation of myofilament proteins cause sarcomere dysfunction and to identify therapeutic avenues to compensate. In humans with type 2 diabetes without HF, we found increased glycation of sarcomeric actin compared to non-diabetics and it correlated with decreased calcium sensitivity. Depressed calcium sensitivity is pathogenic for HF, therefore myofilament glycation represents a promising therapeutic target to inhibit the development of HF in diabetics. To identify possible therapeutic targets, we further defined the molecular actions of myofilament glycation. Skinned myocytes exposed to 100 μM MG exhibited decreased calcium sensitivity, maximal calcium-activated force, and crossbridge kinetics. Replicating MG’s functional affects using a computer simulation of sarcomere function predicted simultaneous decreases in tropomyosin’s blocked-to-closed rate transition and crossbridge duty cycle were consistent with all experimental findings. Stopped-flow experiments and ATPase activity confirmed MG decreased the blocked-to-closed transition rate. Currently, no therapeutics target tropomyosin, so as proof-of-principal, we used a n-terminal peptide of myosin-binding protein C, previously shown to alter tropomyosin’s position on actin.

Here we show that the α1-helix of the α-catenin actin-binding domain (αcat-ABD) is a mechanosensing motif that regulates tension-dependent F-actin binding and bundling. αcat-ABD containing an α1-helix-unfolding mutation (H1) shows enhanced binding to F-actin in vitro. Although full-length α-catenin-H1 can generate epithelial monolayers that resist mechanical disruption, it fails to support normal AJ regulation in vivo. Structural and simulation analyses suggest that α1-helix allosterically controls the actin-binding residue V796 dynamics. Crystal structures of αcat-ABD-H1 homodimer suggest that α-catenin can facilitate actin bundling while it remains bound to E-cadherin.

To further investigate the SCTJ phenotype observed in SCARKO mutants, we generated a new SCARKO model and extensively analyzed the expression of other tight junction components.

Progenitor cells undergo multiple transit amplifying (TA) divisions before initiating terminal differentiation. In the adult male germline, daughter cells arising from the spermatogonial stem cells undergo multiple rounds of TA divisions to produce undifferentiated clones of interconnected 2, 4, 8, and 16 cells, collectively termed Aundifferentiated (Aundiff) spermatogonia, before entering a stereotypic differentiation cascade. Although the number of TA divisions markedly affects the tissue output both at steady state and during regeneration, mechanisms regulating the expansion of the TA cell population are poorly understood in mammals. Here, we show that mice with a conditional deletion of Lin28a in the adult male germline, display impaired clonal expansion of the progenitor TA Aundiff spermatogonia. The in vivo proliferative activity of Aundiff spermatogonial cells as indicated by BrdU incorporation during S-phase was reduced in the absence of LIN28A. Thus, contrary to the role of LIN28A as a key determinant of cell fate signals in multiple stem cell lineages, in the adult male germline it functions as an intrinsic regulator of proliferation in the population of Aundiff TA spermatogonia. In addition, neither precocious differentiation nor diminished capacity for self-renewal potential as assessed by transplantation was observed, suggesting that neither LIN28A itself nor the pool of Aal progenitor cells substantially contribute to the functional stem cell compartment.

Genome-wide transcriptional profiling has revealed similar gene expression signatures in several tumor types and early developmental stages of their tissue of origin. However, it remains unclear whether such a relationship is a universal feature of malignancy, whether heterogeneities exist in the developmental component of different tumor types and to which degree the resemblance between cancer and development is a tissue-specific phenomenon. Results We defined a developmental landscape by summarizing the main features of ten developmental time courses and projected gene expression from a variety of human tumor types onto this landscape. This comparison demonstrates a clear imprint of developmental gene expression in a wide range of tumors and with respect to different, even non-cognate developmental backgrounds. Our analysis reveals three classes of cancers with developmentally distinct transcriptional patterns. We characterize the biological processes dominating these classes and validate the class distinction with respect to a new time series of murine embryonic lung development. Finally, we identify a set of genes that are upregulated in most cancers and we show that this signature is active in early development.

Genome-wide transcriptional profiling has revealed similar gene expression signatures in several tumor types and early developmental stages of their tissue of origin. However, it remains unclear whether such a relationship is a universal feature of malignancy, whether heterogeneities exist in the developmental component of different tumor types and to which degree the resemblance between cancer and development is a tissue-specific phenomenon. Results We defined a developmental landscape by summarizing the main features of ten developmental time courses and projected gene expression from a variety of human tumor types onto this landscape. This comparison demonstrates a clear imprint of developmental gene expression in a wide range of tumors and with respect to different, even non-cognate developmental backgrounds. Our analysis reveals three classes of cancers with developmentally distinct transcriptional patterns. We characterize the biological processes dominating these classes and validate the class distinction with respect to a new time series of murine embryonic lung development. Finally, we identify a set of genes that are upregulated in most cancers and we show that this signature is active in early development.

Electromyography shows denervation, and patients often report that early symptoms include cramps brought on by cold or exertion. Based on reported clinical observations, and studies of mouse models of CMT2D, we sought to determine whether weakened synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an aspect of CMT2D. Quantal analysis of NMJs in two different mouse models of CMT2D (GarsP278KY,GarsC201R), found synaptic deficits that correlated with disease severity and progressed with age. Results of voltage-clamp studies revealed presynaptic defects characterized by: (1) decreased frequency of spontaneous release without any change in quantal amplitude (miniature endplate current), (2) reduced amplitude of evoked release (endplate current) and quantal content, (3) age-dependent changes in the extent of depression in response to repetitive stimulation, and (4) release failures at some NMJs with high-frequency, long-duration stimulation. Drugs that modify synaptic efficacy were tested to see whether neuromuscular performance improved. The presynaptic action of 3,4 diaminopyridine was not beneficial, whereas postsynaptic-acting physostigmine did improve performance. Smaller mutant NMJs with correspondingly fewer vesicles and partial denervation that eliminates some release sites also contribute to the reduction of release at a proportion of mutant NMJs. Together, these voltage-clamp data suggest that a number of release processes, while essentially intact, likely operate suboptimally at most NMJs of CMT2D mice.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe have uncovered a previously unrecognized aspect of axonal Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease in mouse models of CMT2D. Synaptic dysfunction contributes to impaired neuromuscular performance and disease progression. This suggests that drugs which improve synaptic efficacy at the NMJ could be considered in treating the pathophysiology of CMT2D patients.", "year": 2016, "citation_count": 73, "publisher": "Society for Neuroscience"}

As contextual, but not explicit cue, fear conditioning relies on the hippocampus; this has been interpreted as evidence that the hippocampus is not fully developed until PD 23. Alternatively, the hippocampus may be functional prior to PD 23, but unable to cooperate with the amygdala for fearful learning. The current experiments investigate this by separating the phases of conditioning across developmental stages. Rats were allowed to learn about the context on one day and to form the fearful association on another. Rats exposed to the context on PD 17 exhibited significant fear only when trained and tested a week later (PD 23, 24), but not on consecutive days (PD 18, 19), demonstrating that rats can learn about a context as early as PD 17. Further experiments clarify that it is associative mechanisms that are developing between PD 18 and 23.

Mice homozygous for a null allele at the SHP-1 locus have a phenotype of severe inflammation and are hyper-responsive to the TLR4 ligand LPS. TLR4 stimulation in the CNS has been linked to both neuropathic pain and sickness behaviors. To determine if reduction in SHP-1 expression affects LPS-induced behaviors, responses of heterozygous SHP-1-deficient (me/+) and wild-type (+/+) mice to LPS were measured. Chronic (4-week) treatment with LPS induced avoidant behaviors indicative of fear/anxiety in me/+, but not +/+, mice. These behaviors were correlated with a LPS-induced type 2 cytokine, cytokine receptor, and immune effector arginase profile in the brains of me/+ mice not found in +/+ mice. Me/+ mice also had a constitutively greater level of TLR4 in the CNS than +/+ mice. Additionally, me/+ mice displayed constitutively increased thermal sensitivity compared to +/+ mice, measured by the tail-flick test. Moreover, me/+ glial cultures were more responsive to LPS than +/+ glia. Therefore, the reduced expression of SHP-1 in me/+ imparts haploinsufficiency with respect to the control of CNS TLR4 and pain signaling. Furthermore, type 2 cytokines become prevalent during chronic TLR4 hyperstimulation in the CNS and are associated positively with behaviors that are usually linked to type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The extensive overlap in both neural circuitry and cellular events that occur with stress, medication overuse, and migraine provide insight into potential mechanisms that may lead to CDH. Particular attention is devoted to the effect of stress and medication overuse on peripheral and central neuroimmune interactions that can facilitate pain signaling.

Infected B6 mice, like HIV-infected humans, exhibited behavioral (increased sensitivity to mechanical and heat stimuli) and pathological (transient loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers) signs of peripheral neuropathy. The levels of viral gag RNA were significantly increased in all tissues tested, including spleen, paw skin, lumbar dorsal root ganglia, and lumbar spinal cord, postinfection (p.i.).

The following three components of adrenocortical function are known to be regulated by different mechanisms that are mediated via suprahypothalamic, hypothalamic, pituitary, and intra-adrenal influences: basal plasma corticosterone (Cort) levels, plasma Cort response to a 10-min restraint stress, and adrenal weight. Genome scans identified a complex genetic architecture for the basal Cort phenotype, including sex and maternal lineage effects. Pairwise interactions were also identified for this trait. We identified three significant and two suggestive QTLs for stress Cort, along with two pairs of interacting loci for this trait. Four highly significant and two suggestive loci were identified for adrenal weight, with no interacting loci.

Our central result is a simple formula that quantifies the fraction of missing information of any genotyping strategy in a backcross. It includes the special case of selectively genotyping only the phenotypic extreme individuals. The formula is a function of the square of the phenotype and the uncertainty in our knowledge of the genotypes at a locus. This result is used to answer a variety of questions. First, we examine the cost-information trade-off varying the density of markers and the proportion of extreme phenotypic individuals genotyped. Then we evaluate the information content of selective phenotyping designs and the impact of measurement error in phenotyping. A simple formula quantifies the information content of any combined phenotyping and genotyping design. We extend our results to cover multigenotype crosses, such as the F2 intercross, and multiple QTL models. We find that when the QTL effect is small, any contrast in a multigenotype cross benefits from selective genotyping in the same manner as in a backcross. The benefit remains in the presence of a second unlinked QTL with small effect (explaining <20% of the variance), but diminishes if the second QTL has a large effect.

Treated larvae had elevated whole-body cortisol and glucocorticoid signaling, and upregulated genes associated with defense response and immune system processes. In adulthood the treated fish maintained elevated basal cortisol levels in the absence of exogenous cortisol, and constitutively mis-expressed genes involved in defense response and its regulation. Adults derived from cortisol-treated embryos displayed defective tailfin regeneration, heightened basal expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and failure to appropriately regulate those genes following injury or immunological challenge.

Unicellular organisms are transcriptionally potent, able to express their full genetic complement as the need arises through their life cycle, whereas differentiated cells of multicellular organisms can only express a fraction of their genomic potential. Likewise, whereas cell proliferation in unicellular organisms is primarily limited by nutrient availability, cell proliferation in multicellular organisms is developmentally regulated. Repressive genetic controls limiting the potency of cells at the end of ontogeny would have stabilized the gene expression states of differentiated cells and prevented disruptive proliferation, allowing the emergence of diverse cell types and functional shapes. We propose that distal cis‐regulatory elements represent the primary innovations that set the stage for the evolution of developmental gene regulatory networks and the repressive control of key multipotency and cell‐cycle control genes. The testable prediction of this model is that the genomes of extant animals, unlike those of our unicellular relatives, encode gene regulatory circuits dedicated to the developmental control of transcriptional and proliferative potency.

Runx transcription factors are critical regulators of metazoan developmental signaling, and we have shown that the sea urchin Runx gene runt-1, which is globally expressed during early embryogenesis, functions in support of blastula stage cell proliferation and expression of the mitogenic genes pkc1, cyclinD, and several wnts. To obtain a more comprehensive list of early runt-1 regulatory targets, we screened a Strongylocentrotus purpuratus microarray to identify genes mis-expressed in mid-blastula stage runt-1 morphants. This analysis showed that loss of Runx function perturbs the expression of multiple genes involved in cell division, including the pro-growth and survival kinase Akt (PKB), which is significantly underexpressed in runt-1 morphants. Further genomic analysis revealed that Akt is encoded by two genes in the S. purpuratus genome, akt-1 and akt-2, both of which contain numerous canonical Runx target sequences. The transcripts of both genes accumulate several fold during blastula stage, contingent on runt-1 expression. Inhibiting Akt expression or activity causes blastula stage cell cycle arrest, whereas overexpression of akt-1 mRNA rescues cell proliferation in runt-1 morphants. These results indicate that post-cleavage stage cell division requires Runx-dependent expression of akt.", "year": 2013, "citation_count": 9, "publisher": "The Company of Biologists"}

We model a group-structured society in which the transmission of individual behaviour occurs in parallel with the selection of group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behaviour that generates collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behaviour within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in proportion to their fitness. Finally, the behaviour may also spread globally. We find that behaviour and institutions can be mutually reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioural source-sink dynamics when behaviour generated in institutionalized groups spreads to non-institutionalized groups and boosts their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of group-beneficial behaviour creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the evolution of group-beneficial institutions.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate, compare, and contrast different methods for measuring compression delivered by an exemplar compression garment.Design/methodology/approachThe exemplar compression garment is a plain jersey knit maternity band. The compression delivered by this garment was determined via three different methods – Tekscan pressure mapping system, Hohenstein Measurement System (HOSY), and a fabric-based analytical model employing uniaxial fabric tensile data.FindingsHOSY and the fabric-based model, assuming a circular cross section for the garment, provided comparable results for compression versus garment height. However, these methods did not capture the varying compression delivered at different transverse locations when the subject was noncircular in cross section. Assuming an elliptical cross section, the fabric-based model predicted results that were comparable to those measured by the Tekscan system: for example, compressions were approximately 130-160 percent greater at the hip, and approximately 60-100 percent lower at the posterior, than HOSY revealed. Further, the Tekscan system allows the effect of movement on compression to be captured.Originality/valueThis paper compares and contrasts three compression measurement methods and demonstrates the importance of angular position and height dependencies.

IL-6 knockout reduced expression of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), an essential enzyme in serine biosynthesis. Importantly, recombinant IL-6 treatment rescued PSAT1 expression in the TSC2-deficient, IL-6 knockout clones selectively and had no effect on wildtype cells.

These data reveal a novel mechanism through which IL-6 regulates serine biosynthesis, with potential relevance to the therapy of tumors with mTORC1 hyperactivity.ClassificationMajor category: Biological Sciences Minor category: Cell Biology", "year": 2021, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"}

To investigate the mechanisms of exogenous nutrients uptake in Tsc2-deficient cells, we measured dextran uptake, a polysaccharide internalized via macropinocytosis. Tsc2-deficient cells showed a striking increase in dextran uptake (3-fold, p < 0.0001) relative to Tsc2-expressing cells, which was decreased (3-fold, p < 0.0001) with mTOR inhibitor, Torin1. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of the lipid kinase Vps34 markedly abrogated uptake of Dextran in Tsc2-deficient cells. Macropinocytosis was further increased in Tsc2-deficient cells that lack autophagic mechanisms, suggesting that autophagy inhibition leads to dependence on exogenous nutrient uptake in Tsc2-deficient cells. Treatment with a macropinocytosis inhibitor, ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), resulted in selective growth inhibition of Atg5-deficient, Tsc2-deficient cells (50%, p < 0.0001). Genetic inhibition of autophagy (Atg5−/− MEFs) sensitized cells with Tsc2 downregulation to the Vps34 inhibitor, SAR405, resulting in growth inhibition (75%, p < 0.0001). Finally, genetic downregulation of Vps34 inhibited tumor growth and increased tumor latency in an in vivo xenograft model of TSC. Our findings show that macropinocytosis is upregulated with Tsc2-deficiency via a Vps34-dependent mechanism to support their anabolic state. The dependence of Tsc2-deficient cells on exogenous nutrients may provide novel approaches for the treatment of TSC.", "year": 2018, "citation_count": 12, "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}

Nociceptors are the sensory neurons that alert the nervous system to potentially harmful stimuli such as mechanical pressure or noxious thermal temperature. When an injury occurs, the nociceptive threshold for pain is reduced and an increased pain signal is produced. This process is called nociceptive sensitization. This sensitization normally subsides after the injury is healed. However, dysregulation can occur which results in sensitization that persists after the injury has healed. This process is thought to perpetuate chronic pain. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been previously implicated in nociceptive sensitization in response to injury in Drosophila melanogaster. Downstream of Hh signaling, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway has also been shown to be necessary for this process. Here, we describe a role for nuclear components of BMP’s signaling pathway in the formation of injury-induced nociceptive sensitization. Brinker (Brk), and Schnurri (Shn) were suppressed in nociceptors using an RNA-interference (RNAi) “knockdown” approach. Knockdown of Brk resulted in hypersensitivity in the absence of injury, indicating that it normally acts to suppress nociceptive sensitivity. Animals in which transcriptional activator Shn was knocked down in nociceptors failed to develop normal allodynia after ultraviolet irradiation injury, indicating that Shn normally acts to promote hypersensitivity after injury. These results indicate that Brk-related transcription regulators play a crucial role in the formation of nociceptive sensitization and may therefore represent valuable new targets for pain-relieving medications.

This burden also impacts the U.S. economy; 600 billion dollars annually is spent on medical care, medications, and lost productivity in the workplace. Current opioid treatments cause adverse effects including nausea, constipation, tolerance, and addiction liability. Nociceptive sensitization is thought to perpetuate chronic pain, but too little is known about its mechanisms. Components of the pathways that sensitize the nociceptors after injury are likely to be valuable targets for novel medications for the relief or prevention of chronic pain. Utilizing the Drosophila melanogaster cell targeting and RNA interference toolkit, we are investigating the bone morphogenetic protein pathway and its role in ultraviolet light injury-induced nociceptive sensitization. Bone morphogenetic proteins are well known as secreted developmental morphogens that control development, but other functions are known. We have previously identified bone morphogenetic protein signaling components used in nociceptors to modulate injury-induced allodynia, including Decapentaplegic (Dpp, orthologous to mammalian bone morphogenetic protein 2/4), and its downstream signaling components. The morphogen Hedgehog has also been shown to be necessary for allodynia following injury. Here, we show that two membrane-embedded regulators of the Dpp and Hedgehog pathways, Dally and Dally-like, are necessary for injury-induced thermal allodynia, as the formation of sensitization was reduced when either component was suppressed. These bone morphogenetic protein components are highly conserved and, because dysregulation of nociceptor sensitization underlies chronic pain, the homologs of Dally and Dally-like may represent novel therapeutic targets in humans challenged by chronic pain. Furthermore, because of their extracellular location, Dally and Dally-like represent attractive therapeutic drug targets because such drugs would not need to cross the plasma membrane.

It is thought that chronic pain is triggered by nociceptive sensitization, which produces elevated nocifensive responses. A model has been developed in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the underlying mechanisms of chronic pain using ultraviolet-induced tissue injury to trigger thermal allodynia, a nociceptive hypersensitivity to a normally innocuous stimulus. Larvae were assayed for their behavioral latencies to produce a distinct avoidance response under different thermal conditions. Previously, Decapentaplegic, a member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family and orthologous to mammalian BMP2/4, was shown to be necessary for the induction of allodynia. Here, we further investigate the BMP pathway to identify other essential molecules necessary to activate the nociceptive sensitization pathway. Results Using the GAL4-UAS-RNAi system to induce a cell-specific knockdown of gene expression, we further explored BMP pathway components to identify other key players in the induction of nociceptive sensitization by comparing the responses of manipulated animals to those of controls. Here, we show that a second BMP, Glass Bottom Boat, and its receptor Wishful Thinking are both necessary for injury-induced thermal allodynia since the formation of sensitization was found to be severely attenuated when either of these components was suppressed. The effects on pain perception appear to be specific to the sensitization system, as the ability to respond to a normally noxious stimulus in the absence of injury was left intact, and no nociceptor morphological defects were observed. Conclusion These results provide further support of the hypothesis that the BMP pathway plays a crucial role in the development of nociceptive sensitization. Because of its strong conservation between invertebrates and mammals, the BMP pathway may be worthy of future investigation for the development of targeted treatments to alleviate chronic pain.

In stark contrast, salamanders can functionally repair a range of clinically relevant tissues throughout adult life. The impressive ability to regenerate whole limbs after amputation, or regenerate following cardiac injury, is critically dependent on the recruitment of (myeloid) macrophage white blood cells to the site of injury. Amputation in the absence of macrophages results in regeneration failure and scar tissue induction. Identifying the exact hematopoietic source or reservoir of myeloid cells supporting regeneration is a necessary step in characterizing differences in macrophage phenotypes regulating scarring or regeneration across species. Mammalian wounds are dominated by splenic-derived monocytes that originate in the bone marrow and differentiate into macrophages within the wound. Unlike mammals, adult axolotls do not have functional bone marrow but instead utilize liver and spleen tissues as major sites for adult hematopoiesis. To interrogate leukocyte identity, tissue origins, and modes of recruitment, we established several transgenic axolotl hematopoietic tissue transplant models and flow cytometry protocols to study cell migration and identify the source of pro-regenerative macrophages. We identified that although bidirectional trafficking of leukocytes can occur between spleen and liver tissues, the liver is the major source of leukocytes recruited to regenerating limbs. Recruitment of leukocytes and limb regeneration occurs in the absence of the spleen, thus confirming the dependence of liver-derived myeloid cells in regeneration and that splenic maturation is dispensable for the education of pro-regenerative macrophages.

Although infiltrating immune cells play a major role in determining the variable outcome of mammalian wound repair, little is known about the modulation of immune cell signaling in efficiently regenerating species such as the salamander, which can regrow complete body structures as adults. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of immune signaling during limb regeneration in axolotl, an aquatic salamander, and reveal a temporally defined requirement for macrophage infiltration in the regenerative process. Although many features of mammalian cytokine/chemokine signaling are retained in the axolotl, they are more dynamically deployed, with simultaneous induction of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers within the first 24 h after limb amputation. Systemic macrophage depletion during this period resulted in wound closure but permanent failure of limb regeneration, associated with extensive fibrosis and disregulation of extracellular matrix component gene expression.

Recent reports demonstrate that paclitaxel (PTX) robustly increases anti-inflammatory CD4 + T cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and that T cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines are protective against CIPN. However, the mechanism by which CD4 + T cells are activated, and the extent cytokines released by CD4 + T cells target DRG neurons are unknown. Here, we found novel expression of functional major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) protein in DRG neurons, and CD4 + T cells in close proximity to DRG neurons, together suggesting CD4 + T cell activation and targeted cytokine release. MHCII protein is primarily expressed in small nociceptive neurons in male mouse DRG regardless of PTX, while MHCII is induced in small nociceptive neurons in female DRG after PTX. Accordingly, reducing MHCII in small nociceptive neurons increased hypersensitivity to cold only in naïve male mice, but increased severity of PTX-induced cold hypersensitivity in both sexes.

Epac exerts its effects through Rap1 and protein kinase C (PKC). To identify targets of Epac–PKC signaling in sensory neurons of the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG), we profiled PKC substrate proteins phosphorylated in response to the activation of Epac with the proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). A prominent Epac-dependent phospho-protein band induced by PGE2 was identified by mass spectrometry as the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdha1). In dissociated DRG from both males and females, the recruitment of Pdha1 to phospho-protein fractions was rapidly induced by PGE2 and prevented by selective inhibition of Epac2. Epac activation increased mitochondrial respiration, consistent with an increase in Pdha1 function mediated by Epac2. Hindpaw injection of PGE2 induced heat hyperalgesia in males and females, but Pdha1 phosphorylation occurred only in males. Hyperalgesia was attenuated in males but not in females by systemic inhibition of Epac2, and also by a mitochondrial membrane potential uncoupler, dinitrophenol, supporting a role for mitochondrial regulation in acute hyperalgesia. These findings identify a mechanism for the regulation of mitochondrial function by Epac2 that contributes to acute inflammatory hyperalgesia in male mice. Systemic administration of the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib suppressed both PGE2-induced heat hyperalgesia and Pdha1 phosphorylation in DRG of males but not females, suggesting that prostaglandin synthesis within the DRG mediates the phosphorylation of Pdha1 in response to hindpaw insult.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThere has been extensive investigation of mitochondrial dysfunction as a causative factor in neuropathic pain disorders. In contrast, results reported here implicate enhanced mitochondrial function as a contributing factor in the development of acute inflammatory hyperalgesia. We describe a mechanism in which Epac2 activation by prostaglandin receptors leads to phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and an increase in mitochondrial respiration in peripheral sensory neurons. Although Epac2 activation leads to Pdha1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase) phosphorylation in dissociated neurons from mice of both sexes, induction of this pathwayin vivoby hindpaw insult is restricted to males and appears to require intraganglionic prostaglandin synthesis.

To determine the mechanism linking the TCS cytosolic Ca2+ depression to inhibited degranulation, we investigated the effects of TCS on crucial signaling enzymes activated downstream of the Ca2+ rise: protein kinase C (PKC; activated by Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species [ROS]) and phospholipase D (PLD). We found that TCS strongly inhibits PLD activity within 15 minutes post‐antigen, a key mechanism of TCS mast cell inhibition. In addition, experiments using fluorescent constructs and confocal microscopy indicate that TCS delays antigen‐induced translocations of PKCβII, PKCδ and PKC substrate myristoylated alanine‐rich C‐kinase. Surprisingly, TCS does not inhibit PKC activity or overall ability to translocate, and TCS actually increases PKC activity by 45 minutes post‐antigen; these results are explained by the timing of both TCS inhibition of cytosolic Ca2+ (~15+ minutes post‐antigen) and TCS stimulation of ROS (~45 minutes post‐antigen). These findings demonstrate that it is incorrect to assume that all Ca2+‐dependent processes will be synchronously inhibited when cytosolic Ca2+ is inhibited by a toxicant or drug. The results offer molecular predictions of the effects of TCS on other mammalian cell types, which share these crucial signal transduction elements and provide biochemical information that may underlie recent epidemiological findings implicating TCS in human health problems.", "year": 2019, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Wiley"}

However, it remains unclear if these phenotypes manifest before the clinical diagnosis of PD. We utilized longitudinal DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray data from the Parkinson’s Progression Marker’s Initiative (PPMI) to perform immune profiling in clinically defined PD and prodromal PD patients (Prod). We identified previously reported changes in neutrophil, monocyte, and T cell numbers in PD patients. Additionally, we noted previously unrecognized decreases in the naive B cell compartment in the defined PD and Prod patient group. Over time, we observed the proportion of innate immune cells in PD blood increased, but the proportion of adaptive immune cells decreased. We identified decreases in T and B cell subsets associated with REM sleep disturbances and early cognitive decline. Lastly, we identified increases in B memory cells associated with both genetic (LRRK2 genotype) and infectious (cytomegalovirus seropositivity) risk factors of PD.

Exposure to the widely used organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, but the cellular mechanisms underlying CPF toxicity in neurons are not completely understood. We evaluated CPF toxicity in mouse primary cortical neuronal cultures, using RNA-sequencing to identify cellular pathways modulated by CPF. CPF exposure altered the expression of genes associated with intrinsic apoptosis, significantly elevating expression of the pro-apoptotic mediator Bbc3/Puma. Bbc3 loss attenuated CPF driven neurotoxicity, induction of other intrinsic apoptosis regulatory genes including Trp53 and Pmaip1 (encoding the NOXA protein), and cleavage of apoptosis executors caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). CPF exposure was associated with enhanced expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes and proteins and the accumulation of high molecular weight protein species in primary neuronal cultures. No evidence of alterations in the ubiquitin-proteosome system were observed, however, autophagy-related proteins were upregulated in CPF-treated Bbc3−/− neuronal cultures compared with identically exposed WT cultures. Elevated autophagy-related protein expression in Bbc3−/− neuronal cultures was associated with a reduction in CPF-induced high molecular weight alpha-synuclein and tau immunoreactive protein aggregates.

Activity of the proinflammatory NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease and our recent studies in patients suggest that dopaminergic neurons within the degenerating mesencephalon express NLRP3 throughout the progression of PD. Here, we directly test the impact of enhanced inflammasome activity in mesencephalic neurons by characterizing motor function, tissue integrity, and neuroinflammation in aging mice harboring hyper-activating mutations within the endogenous murine Nlrp3 locus, enabled only in cells expressing the dopamine neuron specific Slc6a3 promoter. Methods We compared mice harboring inducible alleles encoding the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome activating mutations Nlrp3A350V and Nlrp3L351P inserted into the endogenous mouse Nlrp3 locus. Tissue specific expression was driven by breeding these animals with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the dopamine neuron specific Slc6a3 promoter. The experimental mice, designed to express hyperactive NLRP3 only when the endogenous mouse Nlrp3 promotor is active in dopaminergic neurons, were analyzed throughout 18 months of aging using longitudinal motor function assessments. Biochemical and histologic analyses of mesencephalic tissues were conducted in 1- and 18-month old animals. Results We observed progressive and significant deficits in motor function in animals expressing Nlrp3L351P, compared with animals expressing Nlrp3WT and Nlrp3A350V. Age-dependent neuroinflammatory changes in the mesencephalon were noted in all animals. Analysis of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in the substantia nigra revealed a significant increase in astrocyte number in animals expressing Nlrp3L351P compared with Nlrp3WT and Nlrp3A350V. Further analysis of Nlrp3L351P striatal tissues indicated genotype specific gliosis, elevated Il1b expression, and both morphologic and gene expression indicators of proinflammatory A1 astrocytes. Conclusions Dopaminergic neurons have the potential to accumulate NLRP3 inflammasome activators with age, including reactive oxygen species, dopamine metabolites, and misfolded proteins. Results indicate the Nlrp3 locus is active in dopaminergic neurons in aging mice, and that the hyperactive Nlrp3L351P allele can drive neuroinflammatory changes in association with progressive behavioral deficits.

Characterizing the cellular and molecular basis of neuroinflammation is critical to understanding its impact on the incidence and progression of PD and other neurologic disorders. Inflammasomes are intracellular pro-inflammatory pattern-recognition receptors capable of initiating and propagating inflammation. These cellular complexes are well characterized in the innate immune system and activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported in microglia. NLRP3 inflammasome activity has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and recent reports, from our laboratory and others, indicate that Nlrp3 is required for neuroinflammation and nigral cell loss in animal models of PD. NLRP3 has not yet been characterized in PD patients. Here we characterize NLRP3 in PD using immunohistologic and genetic approaches. Histologic studies revealed elevated NLRP3 expression in mesencephalic neurons of PD patients. Analysis of exome sequencing data for genetic variation of NLRP3 identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs7525979 that was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing PD. Mechanistic studies conducted in HEK293 cells indicated that the synonymous SNP, NLRP3 rs7525979, alters the efficiency of NLRP3 translation impacting NLRP3 protein stability, ubiquitination state, and solubility.

The sensor is comprised of three parallel capacitors that enable three-axial force measurement while significantly reducing the complexity of fabrication and maintenance associated with three-axis force sensors. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to rigorously quantify different aspects of the sensor's performance. The static and dynamic errors along the three axes were less than 2.28%, which is well within the acceptable range for the intended application. The force sensor could decouple three-axial forces with a cross-sensitivity of less than 2%. The developed sensor also demonstrated desirable repeatability and hysteresis behaviors with almost no drift over long periods of usage.", "year": 2022, "citation_count": 2, "publisher": "ASME International"}

There are currently few effective therapies to treat the disease, although many small-molecule approaches are being pursued. Certain histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown to ameliorate DMD phenotypes in mouse and zebrafish animal models. The HDACi givinostat has shown promise for DMD in clinical trials. However, beyond a small group of HDACi, other classes of epigenetic small molecules have not been broadly and systematically studied for their benefits for DMD. Methods We used an established animal model for DMD, the zebrafish dmd mutant strain sapje . A commercially available library of epigenetic small molecules was used to treat embryonic-larval stages of dmd mutant zebrafish. We used a quantitative muscle birefringence assay in order to assess and compare the effects of small-molecule treatments on dmd mutant zebrafish skeletal muscle structure. Results We performed a novel chemical-combination screen of a library of epigenetic compounds using the zebrafish dmd model. We identified candidate pools of epigenetic compounds that improve skeletal muscle structure in dmd mutant zebrafish. We then identified a specific combination of two HDACi compounds, oxamflatin and salermide, that ameliorated dmd mutant zebrafish skeletal muscle degeneration. We validated the effects of oxamflatin and salermide on dmd mutant zebrafish in an independent laboratory. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of oxamflatin and salermide caused increased levels of histone H4 acetylation in zebrafish larvae. Conclusions Our results provide novel, effective methods for performing a combination of small-molecule screen in zebrafish. Our results also add to the growing evidence that epigenetic small molecules may be promising candidates for treating DMD.

Although these symptoms have been attributed to neurological damage, EtOH may also target skeletal muscle. EtOH exposure during zebrafish primary muscle development or adulthood results in smaller muscle fibers. However, the effects of EtOH exposure on skeletal muscle during the growth period that follows primary muscle development are not well understood. We determined the effects of EtOH exposure on muscle during this phase of development. Strikingly, muscle fibers at this stage are acutely sensitive to EtOH treatment: EtOH induces muscle degeneration. The severity of EtOH-induced muscle damage varies but muscle becomes more refractory to EtOH as muscle develops. NF-kB induction in muscle indicates that EtOH triggers a pro-inflammatory response. EtOH-induced muscle damage is p53-independent. Uptake of Evans blue dye shows that EtOH treatment causes sarcolemmal instability before muscle fiber detachment. Dystrophin-null sapje mutant zebrafish also exhibit sarcolemmal instability. We tested whether Trichostatin A (TSA), which reduces muscle degeneration in sapje mutants, would affect EtOH-treated zebrafish. We found that TSA and EtOH are a lethal combination. EtOH does, however, exacerbate muscle degeneration in sapje mutants. EtOH also disrupts adhesion of muscle fibers to their extracellular matrix at the myotendinous junction: some detached muscle fibers retain beta-Dystroglycan indicating failure of muscle end attachments. Overexpression of Paxillin, which reduces muscle degeneration in zebrafish deficient for beta-Dystroglycan, is not sufficient to rescue degeneration. Taken together, our results suggest that EtOH exposure has pleiotropic deleterious effects on skeletal muscle.", "year": 2018, "citation_count": 14, "publisher": "MDPI AG"}

Of increasing prevalence in Western societies, these conditions carry a high burden of care. Dietary patterns and environmental factors have a profound effect on shaping gut microbiota in real time. Diverse populations of intestinal bacteria mediate their beneficial effects through the fermentation of dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, endogenous signals with important roles in lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Recent progress shows that an individual’s starting microbial profile is a key determinant in predicting their response to intervention with live probiotics. The gut microbiota is complex and challenging to characterize. Enterotypes have been proposed using metrics such as alpha species diversity, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla, and the relative abundance of beneficial genera (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia) versus facultative anaerobes (E. coli), pro-inflammatory Ruminococcus, or nonbacterial microbes.

TO-modified steels are as mechanically durable as bare steel and highly tolerant to compressive and tensile stresses due to chemical bonding to the substrate and island-like morphology. When inherently superhydrophilic TO coatings are converted to superhydrophobic, they remain non-wetting even after impingement with yttria-stabilized-zirconia particles, or exposure to ultraviolet light and extreme temperatures.

We show that four or more LbL cycles introduce sufficient surface roughness to effectively immobilize the lubricant into the nanoporous coating and provide a stable liquid interface that repels water, low‐surface‐tension liquids and complex fluids. The absence of hierarchical structures and the small size of the silica nanoparticles enables complete transparency of the coating, with light transmittance exceeding that of normal glass. The coating is mechanically robust, maintains its repellency after exposure to continuous flow for several days and prevents adsorption of streptavidin as a model protein.

Glucosinolate compounds are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts, especially glucoraphanin (GLR), and can be metabolized by certain mammalian gut bacteria into anti-inflammatory isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Gut microbiota exhibit biogeographic patterns, but it is unknown if colitis alters these or whether the location of glucoraphanin-metabolizing bacteria affects anti-inflammatory benefits. We fed specific pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice either a control diet or a 10% steamed broccoli sprout diet and gave a three-cycle regimen of 2.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water over a 34-day experiment to simulate chronic, relapsing ulcerative colitis (UC). We monitored body weight, fecal characteristics, lipocalin, serum cytokines, and bacterial communities from the luminal- and mucosal-associated populations in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet with DSS treatment performed better than mice fed the control diet with DSS, and had significantly more weight gain, lower Disease Activity Index scores, lower plasma lipocalin and proinflammatory cytokines, and higher bacterial richness in all gut locations. Bacterial communities were assorted by gut location but were more homogenous across locations in the control diet + DSS mice. Importantly, our results showed that broccoli sprout feeding abrogated the effects of DSS on gut microbiota, as bacterial richness and biogeography were similar between mice receiving broccoli sprouts with and without DSS. Collectively, these results support the protective effect of steamed broccoli sprouts against dysbiosis and colitis induced by DSS. IMPORTANCE Evaluating bacterial communities across different locations in the gut provides a greater insight than fecal samples alone and provides an additional metric by which to evaluate beneficial host-microbe interactions. Here, we show that 10% steamed broccoli sprouts in the diet protects mice from the negative effects of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, that colitis erases biogeographic patterns of bacterial communities in the gut, and that the cecum is not likely to be a significant contributor to colonic bacteria of interest in the DSS mouse model of ulcerative colitis. Mice fed the broccoli sprout diet during colitis performed better than mice fed the control diet while receiving DSS. The identification of accessible dietary components and concentrations that help maintain and correct the gut microbiome may provide universal and equitable approaches to IBD prevention and recovery, and broccoli sprouts represent a promising strategy.

Recent technological advances have enabled the interrogation of neural circuits with ever greater temporal and spatial resolution. These techniques are increasingly being applied across animal models of stroke and to human stroke survivors, and are shedding light on the molecular, structural, and functional changes that neural circuits undergo after stroke.

On a more global scale, we then discuss how effects on long-range pathways, including interhemispheric interactions and corticospinal tract transmission, contribute to post-stroke impairments.

In parallel, numerical simulations with the discrete elastic rods algorithm are used to reproduce the experimental observations. Tabletop experiments are performed where overhand knots with a variety of unknotting numbers are pulled tight. The force–extension curve of these experiments shows that the proposed process can successfully tune the friction between rods.", "year": 2022, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "ASME International"}

Their controlled delivery in hard-to-reach places through entrainment is possible but challenging due to the density mismatch between them and the liquid matrix called liquid carrier system (LCS). In this work, the particle transfer mechanism from the complex density mismatching mixture was investigated. The LCS solution was prepared and optimized using a polymer binder and an evaporating solvent. The inorganic particles were dispersed in the LCS by stirring at the just suspending speed to maintain the pseudo suspension characteristics for the heterogeneous mixture. The effect of solid loading and the binder volume fraction on solid transfer has been reported at room temperature. Two coating regimes are observed (i) heterogeneous coating where particle clusters are formed at a low capillary number and (ii) effective viscous regime, where full coverage can be observed on the substrate. ‘Zero’ particle entrainment was not observed even at a low capillary number of the mixture, which can be attributed to the presence of the binder and hydrodynamic flow of the particles due to the stirring of the mixture. The critical film thickness for particle entrainment is $${h}^{*}=0.16a$$ h ∗ = 0.16 a for 6.5% binder and $${h}^{*}=0.26a$$ h ∗ = 0.26 a for 10.5% binder, which are smaller than previously reported in literature. Furthermore, the transferred particle matrices closely follow the analytical expression (modified LLD) of density matching suspension which demonstrate that the density mismatch effect can be neutralized with the stirring energy. The findings of this research will help to understand this high-volume solid transfer technique and develop novel manufacturing processes.", "year": 2022, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}

Even when ongoing pain is well controlled, patients can suffer breakthrough pain (BTP), episodic severe pain that “breaks through” the medication. We developed a novel model of cancer-induced BTP using female rats with mammary adenocarcinoma cells sealed within the tibia. We demonstrated previously that rats with bone cancer learn to prefer a context paired with saphenous nerve block to elicit pain relief (i.e., conditioned place preference, CPP), revealing the presence of ongoing pain. Treatment with systemic morphine abolished CPP to saphenous nerve block, demonstrating control of ongoing pain. Here, we show that pairing BTP induced by experimenter-induced movement of the tumor-bearing hindlimb with a context produces conditioned place avoidance (CPA) in rats treated with morphine to control ongoing pain, consistent with clinical observation of BTP. Preventing movement-induced afferent input by saphenous nerve block before, but not after, hindlimb movement blocked movement-induced BTP. Ablation of isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding, but not TRPV1+, sensory afferents eliminated movement-induced BTP, suggesting that input from IB4-binding fibers mediates BTP. Identification of potential molecular targets specific to this population of fibers may allow for the development of peripherally restricted analgesics that control BTP and improve quality of life in patients with skeletal metastases.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe present a novel preclinical measure of movement-induced breakthrough pain (BTP) that is observed in the presence of morphine controlling ongoing pain. Blockade of sensory input before movement prevented BTP, whereas nerve block after movement failed to reverse BTP. These observations indicate that blocking peripheral sensory input may prevent BTP and targeting central sites may be required for pain relief once BTP has been initiated. Preventing sensory input from TRPV1-expressing fibers failed to alter movement-induced BTP. In contrast, preventing sensory input from isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding fibers blocked movement-induced BTP. Therefore, examining molecular targets on this population of nociceptive fibers may prove useful for developing an improved strategy for preventing BTP in cancer patients with skeletal metastases.", "year": 2017, "citation_count": 11, "publisher": "Society for Neuroscience"}

Tools for lifespan prediction could accelerate these studies and reduce the need for veterinary intervention. Here, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal frailty and lifespan data on two genetically distinct mouse cohorts to evaluate noninvasive strategies to predict life expectancy in mice. We applied a modified frailty assessment, the Fragility Index, derived from existing frailty indices with additional deficits selected by veterinarians. We developed an ensemble machine learning classifier to predict imminent mortality (95% proportion of life lived [95PLL]). Our algorithm represented improvement over previous predictive criteria but fell short of the level of reliability that would be needed to make advanced prediction of lifespan and thus accelerate lifespan studies. Highly sensitive and specific frailty-based predictive endpoint criteria for aged mice remain elusive. While frailty-based prediction falls short as a surrogate for lifespan, it did demonstrate significant predictive power and as such must contain information that could be used to inform the conclusion of aging experiments.

It, is expressed within blood vessels and perivascular adipose tissue. We hypothesized that loss of RAB27A would alter cardiovascular function. METHODS: Body weight of Rab27a ash mice was measured from 2 to 18 months of age, along with glucose resorption at 6 and 12 months of age and glucose sensitivity at 18 months of age. Body weight and cellular and molecular features of perivascular adipose tissue and aortic tissue were examined in a novel C57BL/6J Rab27a null strain. Analyses included morphometric quantification and proteomic analyses. Wire myography measured vasoreactivity, and echocardiography measured cardiac function. Comparisons across ages and genotypes were evaluated via 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparison testing. Significance for myography was determined via 4-parameter nonlinear regression testing. RESULTS: Genome-wide association data linked rare human RAB27A variants with body mass index and glucose handling. Changes in glucose tolerance were observed in Rab27a ash male mice at 18 months of age. In WT (wild-type) and Rab27a null male mice, body weight, adipocyte lipid area, and aortic area increased with age. In female mice, only body weight increased with age, independent of RAB27A presence. Protein signatures from male Rab27a null mice suggested greater associations with cardiovascular and metabolic phenotypes compared with female tissues. Wire myography results showed Rab27a null males exhibited increased vasoconstriction and reduced vasodilation at 8 weeks of age. Rab27a null females exhibited increased vasoconstriction and vasodilation at 20 weeks of age. Consistent with these vascular changes, male Rab27a null mice experienced age-related cardiomyopathy, with severe differences observed by 21 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Global RAB27A loss impacted perivascular adipose tissue and thoracic aorta proteomic signatures, altered vasocontractile responses, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction in mice.

However, risk assessment in laboratory mice typically involves isogenic strains and therefore, does not account for these known genetic effects. In this context, genetically heterogenous cell lines from laboratory mice are promising tools for population-based screening because they provide a way to introduce genetic variation in risk assessment without increasing animal use. Cell lines from genetic reference populations of laboratory mice offer genetic diversity, power for genetic mapping, and potentially, predictive value for in vivo experimentation in genetically matched individuals. To explore this further, we derived a panel of fibroblast lines from a genetic reference population of laboratory mice (the Diversity Outbred, DO). We then used high-content imaging to capture hundreds of cell morphology traits in cells exposed to the oxidative stress-inducing arsenic metabolite monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII). We employed dose-response modeling to capture latent parameters of response and we then used these parameters to identify several hundred cell morphology quantitative trait loci (cmQTL). Response cmQTL encompass genes with established associations with cellular responses to arsenic exposure, including Abcc4 and Txnrd1, as well as novel gene candidates like Xrcc2. Moreover, baseline trait cmQTL highlight the influence of natural variation on fundamental aspects of nuclear morphology. We show that the natural variants influencing response include both coding and non-coding variation, and that cmQTL haplotypes can be used to predict response in orthogonal cell lines.

The ablation of Sox11 caused severe reduction in sensory neuron survival in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, although it did not affect migration of neural crest cells or acquisition of major sensory neuron subtypes.

Here, we present composite air filters featuring a bio-inspired liquid coating that facilitates the removal of captured aerosolized bacteria and viruses for further analysis. We tested three types of air filters: commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is well-known for creating stable liquid coatings, commercial high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which are widely used, and in-house manufactured cellulose nanofiber mats (CNFM), which are made from sustainable materials. All filters were coated with omniphobic fluorinated liquid to maximize release. We found that coating both the PTFE and HEPA filters with liquid improved the rate at which Escherichia coli was recovered using a physical removal process compared to uncoated controls. Notably, the coated HEPA filters also increased the total number of recovered cells by 57%. Coating the CNFM filters did not improve either the rate of release or total number of captured cells. The ability of the highest performance materials, the liquid-coated HEPA filters were next evaluated on their ability to facilitate the removal of pathogenic viruses via a chemical removal process. Recovery of infectious JC polyomavirus, a non-enveloped virus which attacks the central nervous system, was increased by 92% over uncoated controls; however, there was no significant difference in the total amount of RNA recovered compared to controls. In contrast, significantly more RNA was recovered for SARS-CoV-2, the airborne, enveloped virus which causes COVID-19, from liquid-coated filters. Although the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 recovered was 58% higher, these results were not significantly different from uncoated filters due to high variability.

The underlying mechanisms of astrocytic infection are poorly understood, yet recent findings suggest critical differences in JCPyV infection of primary astrocytes compared to a widely studied immortalized cell model. RNA sequencing was performed in primary normal human astrocytes (NHAs) to analyze the transcriptomic profile that emerges during JCPyV infection. Through a comparative analysis, it was validated that JCPyV requires the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway, and additionally requires the expression of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Specifically, the expression of DUSP1 is needed to establish a successful infection in NHAs, yet this was not observed in an immortalized cell model of JCPyV infection. Additional analyses demonstrated immune activation uniquely observed in NHAs. These results support the hypothesis that DUSPs within the MAPK/ERK pathway impact viral infection and influence potential downstream targets and cellular pathways.

Potential applications include ultrafiltration, biological separations and drug delivery, and separators in lithium-ion batteries. Despite advancements in synthesis and characterization of these membranes, a quantitative description of the membrane microstructure remains a challenge. Currently the membrane microstructure is characterized by the combination of results from several techniques, i.e., gas permeance testing, x-ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and permporometry. The results from these ensemble methods are then compiled and the data fitted to a particular flow model. Although these methods are very effective in determining membrane performance, general pore size distribution, and defect concentration, they are unable to monitor molecular paths through the membrane and quantitatively measure molecular interactions between the molecular specie and pore network. Single-molecule imaging techniques enable optical measurements that probe materials on nanometer length scales through observation of individual molecules without the influence of averaging. Using single-molecule imaging spectroscopy, we can quantitatively characterize the interaction between the probe molecule and the interior of the pore within mesoporous silica membranes. This approach is radically different from typical membrane characterization methods in that it has the potential to spatially sample the underlying pore structure distribution, the surface energy, and the transport properties. Our hope is that this new fundamental knowledge can be quantitatively linked to both the preparation and the performance of membranes, leading to the advancement of membrane science and technology. Fluorescent molecules, 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindo-carbocyanine perchlorate, used to interrogate the available free volume in their vicinity, were loaded into the mesoporous silica membranes at subnanomolar concentrations. The mesoporous silica films were prepared using a nonionic ethylene oxide-propylene oxide-ethylene oxide triblock copolymer surfactant, Pluronic P123, on single crystal silicon substrates using dip coating of a silica sol. Membranes were prepared resulting in an average pore diameter of approximately 5nm as measured by helium, nitrogen permeance, and porosimetry. Fluorescent images and time transient experiments were recorded using a custom built single-molecule scanning confocal microscope at differing temperatures (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50°C).

This study examined the effect of dry eye on the response properties of corneal cool cells and the ability of the TRPM8 agonist menthol to modify these properties. A unilateral dry eye condition was created in rats by removing the left lacrimal gland. Lacrimal gland removal reduced tears in the dry eye to 35% compared with the contralateral eye and increased the number of spontaneous blinks in the dry eye by over 300%. Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed 8–10 wk following surgery in the trigeminal ganglion of dry eye animals and age-matched controls. Responses of corneal cool cells to cooling were examined after the application of menthol (10 μM–1.0 mM) to the ocular surface. The peak frequency of discharge to cooling was higher and the cooling threshold was warmer in dry eye animals compared with controls. The dry condition also altered the neuronal sensitivity to menthol, causing desensitization to cold-evoked responses at concentrations that produced facilitation in control animals. The menthol-induced desensitization of corneal cool cells would likely result in reduced tearing, a deleterious effect in individuals with dry eye.

In addition, chronic daily headache sufferers and chronic opioid users both lack the inhibition of pain produced by noxious stimulation of a distal body region, often referred to as diffuse noxious inhibitory controls. Methods.— In urethane anesthetized rats, Fos‐positive neurons were quantified in chronic morphine and vehicle‐treated animals following 52°C noxious thermal stimulation of the cornea with and without the application of a spatially remote noxious stimulus (placement of the tail in 55°C water). Results.— When compared to chronic morphine‐treated animals that did not receive the spatially remote noxious stimulus, chronic morphine‐treated animals given corneal stimulation along with the spatially remote noxious stimulus demonstrated a 163% increase ( P < .05) in the number of Fos‐positive neurons in the superficial laminae of the medullary dorsal horn and a 682% increase ( P < .01) in deep laminae that was restricted to the side ipsilateral to the applied stimulus. In contrast, no significant difference was found in Fos‐like immunoreactivity in vehicle‐treated animals given concurrent cornea and tail stimulation or only cornea stimulation in either superficial or deep laminae.

MOH arises from the frequent use of medications used for the treatment of a primary headache. Medications that can cause MOH include opioid analgesics as well as formulations designed for the treatment of migraine, such as triptans, ergot alkaloids, or drug combinations that include caffeine and barbiturates. Literature review: Gathering evidence indicates that migraine patients are more susceptible to development of MOH, and that prolonged use of these medications increases the prognosis for development of chronic migraine, leading to the suggestion that similar underlying mechanisms may drive both migraine headache and MOH. In this review, we examine the link between several mechanisms that have been linked to migraine headache and a potential role in MOH. For example, cortical spreading depression (CSD), associated with migraine development, is increased in frequency with prolonged use of topiramate or paracetamol. Conclusions: Increased CGRP levels in the blood have been linked to migraine and elevated CGRP can be casued by prolonged sumatriptan exposure. Possible mechanisms that may be common to both migraine and MOH include increased endogenous facilitation of pain and/or diminished diminished endogenous pain inhibition. Neuroanatomical pathways mediating these effects are examined. ", "year": 2011, "citation_count": 55, "publisher": "SAGE Publications"}

The purpose of the present study was to examine the receptive field properties of second-order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus that respond to drying of the ocular surface. Single-unit electrophysiological recordings were performed in anesthetized rats, and dry-responsive corneal units were isolated in the brain stem at the transition zone between the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis and subnucleus interpolaris. Corneal units were characterized according to their responses to changes in temperature (cooling and heating), hyperosmotic artificial tears, menthol, and low pH. All dry-responsive neurons ( n = 18) responded to cooling of the ocular surface. In addition, these neurons responded to hyperosmotic stimuli and menthol application to the cornea. One-half of the neurons were activated by low pH, and these acid-sensitive neurons were also activated by noxious heat. Furthermore, neurons that were activated by low pH had a significantly lower response to cooling and menthol. These results indicate that dry-responsive neurons recorded in the trigeminal nucleus receive input from cold, sensitive primary afferent neurons, with a subset of these neurons receiving input from corneal primary afferent neurons sensitive to acid and noxious heat.

The majority of clinical M. abscessus isolates carry one or more prophages that are hypothesized to contribute to virulence and bacterial fitness. The prophage McProf was identified in the genome of the Bergey strain of M. chelonae, and is distinct from previously described prophages of M. abscessus. The McProf genome increases intrinsic antibiotic resistance of M. chelonae and drives expression of the intrinsic antibiotic resistance gene, whiB7, when superinfected by a second phage. The prevalence of McProf-like genomes was determined in sequenced mycobacterial genomes. Related prophage genomes were identified in the genomes of 25 clinical isolates of M. abscessus and assigned to the novel cluster, MabR.

Mouse gestation lasts only 3 weeks, during which the genome orchestrates the astonishing transformation of a single-cell zygote into a free-living pup composed of more than 500 million cells. Here, to establish a global framework for exploring mammalian development, we applied optimized single-cell combinatorial indexing 3 to profile the transcriptional states of 12.4 million nuclei from 83 embryos, precisely staged at 2- to 6-hour intervals spanning late gastrulation (embryonic day 8) to birth (postnatal day 0). From these data, we annotate hundreds of cell types and explore the ontogenesis of the posterior embryo during somitogenesis and of kidney, mesenchyme, retina and early neurons. We leverage the temporal resolution and sampling depth of these whole-embryo snapshots, together with published data 4–8 from earlier timepoints, to construct a rooted tree of cell-type relationships that spans the entirety of prenatal development, from zygote to birth. Throughout this tree, we systematically nominate genes encoding transcription factors and other proteins as candidate drivers of the in vivo differentiation of hundreds of cell types. Remarkably, the most marked temporal shifts in cell states are observed within one hour of birth and presumably underlie the massive physiological adaptations that must accompany the successful transition of a mammalian fetus to life outside the womb.

Genetic correlations reveal that predisposing drug-naïve phenotypes, including anxiety, depression, novelty preference, and sensation seeking, are predictive of drug-use phenotypes, implicating shared genetic mechanisms. Because of this relationship, high-throughput behavioral screening of predictive phenotypes in knockout (KO) mice allows efficient discovery of genes likely to be involved in drug use. We used this strategy in two rounds of screening in which we identified 33 drug-use candidate genes and ultimately validated the perturbation of 22 of these genes as causal drivers of substance intake. In our initial round of screening, we employed the two-bottle-choice paradigms to assess alcohol, methamphetamine, and nicotine intake. We identified 19 KO strains that were extreme responders on at least one predictive phenotype. Thirteen of the 19 gene deletions (68%) significantly affected alcohol use three methamphetamine use, and two both. In the second round of screening, we employed a multivariate approach to identify outliers and performed validation using methamphetamine two-bottle choice and ethanol drinking-in-the-dark protocols. We identified 15 KO strains that were extreme responders across the predisposing drug-naïve phenotypes. Eight of the 15 gene deletions (53%) significantly affected intake or preference for three alcohol, eight methamphetamine or three both (3). We observed multiple relations between predisposing behaviors and drug intake, revealing many distinct biobehavioral processes underlying these relationships.

Computational analysis of whole-genome sequencing data detects 26 unique sequence variants at 23 predicted off-target sites for 18/163 guides used.

As yet, there are no published reference ranges for electrocardiography (ECG) in the laboratory mouse. The first mouse-specific reference ranges for the assessment of electrical conduction are reported herein generated from an ECG dataset of unprecedented scale. International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium data from over 26,000 conscious or anesthetized C57BL/6N wildtype control mice were stratified by sex and age to develop robust ECG reference ranges. Interesting findings include that heart rate and key elements from the ECG waveform (RR-, PR-, ST-, QT-interval, QT corrected, and QRS complex) demonstrate minimal sexual dimorphism. As expected, anesthesia induces a decrease in heart rate and was shown for both inhalation (isoflurane) and injectable (tribromoethanol) anesthesia. In the absence of pharmacological, environmental, or genetic challenges, we did not observe major age-related ECG changes in C57BL/6N-inbred mice as the differences in the reference ranges of 12-week-old compared to 62-week-old mice were negligible. The generalizability of the C57BL/6N substrain reference ranges was demonstrated by comparison with ECG data from a wide range of non-IMPC studies. The close overlap in data from a wide range of mouse strains suggests that the C57BL/6N-based reference ranges can be used as a robust and comprehensive indicator of normality.

Owing to the similarity in anatomy and physiology between human and mouse eyes and the ability to genetically manipulate mice, mouse models are an invaluable resource for studying mechanisms underlying disease phenotypes and for developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we report the discovery of a new mouse model of early-onset glaucoma that bears a transversion substitution c. G344T, which results in a missense mutation, p. R115L in PITX2. The mutation causes an elevation in intraocular pressure (IOP) and progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC). These ocular phenotypes recapitulate features of pathologies observed in human glaucoma. Increased oxidative stress was evident in the inner retina. We demonstrate that the mutant PITX2 protein was not capable of binding to Nuclear factor-like 2 (NRF2), which regulates Pitx2 expression and nuclear localization, and to YAP1, which is necessary for co-initiation of transcription of downstream targets. PITX2-mediated transcription of several antioxidant genes were also impaired. Treatment with N-Acetyl-L-cysteine exerted a profound neuroprotective effect on glaucoma-associated neuropathies, presumably through inhibition of oxidative stress.

A major contributor to nociception from the muscles is mechanosensation. However, due to the heterogeneity in the expression of proteins, such as ion channels, pumps, and exchangers, on muscle nociceptors, we currently do not know the relative contributions of different proteins and signaling molecules to the neuronal response due to mechanical stimuli. In this study, we employed an integrated approach combining a customized experimental study in mice with a computational model to identify key proteins that regulate mechanical nociception in muscles. First, using newly collected data from somatosensory recordings in mouse hindpaw muscles, we developed and then validated a computational model of a mechanosensitive mouse muscle nociceptor. Next, by performing global sensitivity analyses that simulated thousands of nociceptors, we identified three ion channels (among the 17 modeled transmembrane proteins and four endoplasmic reticulum proteins) as potential regulators of the nociceptor response to mechanical forces in both the innocuous and noxious range. Moreover, we found that simulating single knockouts of any of the three ion channels, delayed rectifier voltage-gated K+ channel (Kv1.1) or mechanosensitive channels Piezo2 or TRPA1, considerably altered the excitability of the nociceptor (i.e., each knockout increased or decreased the number of triggered APs compared to when all channels were present).

Rats were exposed to RCS because these animals have been used as a model for fibromyalgia syndrome. Depression-like behavior was evaluated using elongation of immobility time in a forced swimming test. Change in expression of BDNF in the brain was also examined by western blot analysis of several brain areas. Depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test was significantly increased 10–14 days after RCS, and this increase was reversed by a single injection of an antidepressant, imipramine, but not by PBS. Increased depression-like behavior was also dose-dependently suppressed by a single administration of Neurotropin (50–200 NU/kg, subcutaneously). BDNF expression was not changed in the brain areas examined (hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and striatum) either after RCS or by Neurotropin injected after RCS.

We have previously shown in our model of transient ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury of the forelimb that individual group III and IV muscle afferents display altered chemosensitivity and mechanical thresholds 1 day after injury. Functional alterations corresponded to increased evoked and spontaneous pain-related behaviors and decreased muscle strength and voluntary activity—all actions that echo clinical symptoms of ischemic myalgia. These behavioral and physiological changes appeared to originate in part from the action of increased interleukin 1β (IL1β) in the injured muscles at its upregulated IL1 receptor 1 within the dorsal root ganglion. Here, we describe that two days of voluntary wheel running prior to I/R blocks both injury-induced IL1β enhancement and the subsequent development of ischemic myalgia-like behaviors. Furthermore, the protective effects of 2 days prior exercise on the I/R-evoked increases in pain-related behaviors were also paralleled with systemic injection of the IL1 receptor antagonist during I/R. Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist treatment additionally prevented the I/R-induced changes in mechanical and chemical sensitivity of individual primary muscle afferents.

ICS test samples are commonly prepared from animal or human tissues as unpurified cell mixtures, and cell-specific cytokine signals are subsequently discriminated by gating strategies using flow cytometry. Here, we show that when ICS samples contain Ly6G+ neutrophils, neutrophils are ex vivo activated by an ICS reagent – phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) – which leads to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release and death of cytokine-expressing T cells. This artifact is likely to result in overinterpretation of the degree of T cell suppression, misleading immunological research related to cancer, infection, and inflammation. We accordingly devised easily implementable improvements to the ICS method and propose alternative methods for assessing or confirming cellular cytokine expression.", "year": 2022, "citation_count": 12, "publisher": "Frontiers Media SA"}

In preclinical models of solid tumors, both pro-metastatic and anti-metastatic effects of neutrophils have been reported. In this study, using mouse models of breast cancer, we demonstrate that the metastasis-modulating effects of neutrophils are dictated by the status of host natural killer (NK) cells. In NK cell-deficient mice, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-expanded neutrophils show an inhibitory effect on the metastatic colonization of breast tumor cells in the lung. In contrast, in NK cell-competent mice, neutrophils facilitate metastatic colonization in the same tumor models. In an ex vivo neutrophil-NK cell-tumor cell tri-cell co-culture system, neutrophils are shown to potentially suppress the tumoricidal activity of NK cells, while neutrophils themselves are tumoricidal. Intriguingly, these two modulatory effects by neutrophils are both mediated by reactive oxygen species. Collectively, the absence or presence of NK cells, governs the net tumor-modulatory effects of neutrophils.", "year": 2020, "citation_count": 127, "publisher": "Springer Science and Business Media LLC"}

However, these studies used a limited range of cognitive measures and did not control for cardiovascular disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) and baseline function. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the associations of VA and cognitive performance using a thorough neuropsychological test battery. Methods: This study used community-dwelling sample data across the sixth (2001–2006) and seventh (2006–2010) waves of the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study (n=655). Wave 6 VA as measured by the Snellen Eye Test was the primary predictor of wave 6 and wave 7 Global cognitive performance, Visual-Spatial Organization and Memory, Verbal Episodic Memory, Working Memory, Scanning and Tracking, and Executive Function. Additionally, VA was used to predict longitudinal changes in wave 7 cognitive performance (wave 6 performance adjusted). We analyzed these relationships with multiple linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, ethnicity, depressive symptoms, physical function deficits in addition to CVD-RFs, chronic kidney disease, homocysteine, continuous systolic blood pressure, and hypertension status. Results: Adjusted for demographic covariates and CVD-RFs, poorer VA was associated with concurrent and approximate 5-year declines in Global cognitive function, Visual-Spatial Organization and Memory, and Verbal Episodic Memory. Discussion: VA may be used in combination with other screening measures to determine risk for cognitive decline.

Methods: The prospective analysis employed 508 community-dwelling participants (mean age 61 years, 60% women) from the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study. Pulse wave velocity at wave 7 (2006-2010) was compared between those with type 2 diabetes mellitus at wave 6 (2001-2006) (n = 52) and non-diabetics at wave 6 (n = 456), with adjustment for demographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle- and pulse wave velocity-related factors. Results: Type 2 diabetes mellitus status was associated with a significantly higher pulse wave velocity (12.5 ± 0.36 vs. 10.4 ± 0.12 m/s). Multivariate adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle- and pulse wave velocity-related variables did not attenuate the findings. The risk of an elevated pulse wave velocity (≥12 m/s) was over 9 times higher for those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus than for those without diabetes (OR 9.14, 95% CI 3.23-25.9, p < 0.001).

Here, we identify proteins in sera of patients and mouse models with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) with characteristics that make them suitable as biomarkers in clinical practice and therapeutic trials.We collected serum from mouse models of CMT1A (C61 het), CMT2D (GarsC201R, GarsP278KY), CMT1X (Gjb1-null), CMT2L (Hspb8K141N) and from CMT patients with genotypes including CMT1A (PMP22d), CMT2D (GARS), CMT2N (AARS) and other rare genetic forms of CMT. The severity of neuropathy in the patients was assessed by the CMT Neuropathy Examination Score (CMTES). We performed multitargeted proteomics on both sample sets to identify proteins elevated across multiple mouse models and CMT patients. Selected proteins and additional potential biomarkers, such as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and cell free mitochondrial DNA, were validated by ELISA and quantitative PCR, respectively.We propose that neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) is a candidate biomarker for CMT, as it was elevated in Gjb1-null, Hspb8K141N, GarsC201R and GarsP278KY mice as well as in patients with both demyelinating (CMT1A) and axonal (CMT2D, CMT2N) forms of CMT. We show that NCAM1 may reflect disease severity, demonstrated by a progressive increase in mouse models with time and a significant positive correlation with CMTES neuropathy severity in patients. The increase in NCAM1 may reflect muscle regeneration triggered by denervation, which could potentially track disease progression or the effect of treatments.We found that member proteins of the complement system were elevated in Gjb1-null and Hspb8K141N mouse models as well as in patients with both demyelinating and axonal CMT, indicating possible complement activation at the impaired nerve terminals. However, complement proteins did not correlate with the severity of neuropathy measured on the CMTES scale. Although the complement system does not seem to be a prognostic biomarker, we do show complement elevation to be a common disease feature of CMT, which may be of interest as a therapeutic target.We also identify serum GDF15 as a highly sensitive diagnostic biomarker, which was elevated in all CMT genotypes as well as in Hspb8K141N, Gjb1-null, GarsC201R and GarsP278KY mouse models. Although we cannot fully explain its origin, it may reflect increased stress response or metabolic disturbances in CMT.

When GCN2 was genetically deleted or inhibited with drugs, the stress response was blocked, and the neuropathy was much milder. Zuko et al . found that mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetases bind tRNA Gly but fail to release it, thus depleting the cellular tRNA Gly pool. This process caused stalling of translating ribosomes on glycine codons and activated the integrated stress response.

Of increasing prevalence in Western societies, these conditions carry a high burden of care. Dietary patterns and environmental factors have a profound effect on shaping gut microbiota in real time. Diverse populations of intestinal bacteria mediate their beneficial effects through the fermentation of dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, endogenous signals with important roles in lipid homeostasis and reducing inflammation. Recent progress shows that an individual’s starting microbial profile is a key determinant in predicting their response to intervention with live probiotics. The gut microbiota is complex and challenging to characterize. Enterotypes have been proposed using metrics such as alpha species diversity, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla, and the relative abundance of beneficial genera (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia) versus facultative anaerobes (E. coli), pro-inflammatory Ruminococcus, or nonbacterial microbes. Microbiota composition and relative populations of bacterial species are linked to physiologic health along different axes. We review the role of diet quality, carbohydrate intake, fermentable FODMAPs, and prebiotic fiber in maintaining healthy gut flora.

While many lines have proven to be useful for investigating gene function, many have also shown no apparent phenotype, or phenotypes not of interest to the originating lab. In order for labs to document and share information about these lines, we have created ZebraShare as a new resource offered within ZFIN. Methods ZebraShare involves a form-based submission process generated by ZFIN. The ZebraShare interface ( https://zfin.org/action/zebrashare ) can be accessed on ZFIN under “Submit Data”. Users download the Submission Workbook and complete the required fields, then submit the completed workbook with associated images and captions, generating a new ZFIN publication record. ZFIN curators add the submitted phenotype and mutant information to the ZFIN database, provide mapping information about mutations, and cross reference this information across the appropriate ZFIN databases. We present here examples of ZebraShare submissions, including phf21aa, kdm1a, ctnnd1, snu13a, and snu13b mutant lines. Results Users can find ZebraShare submissions by searching ZFIN for specific alleles or line designations, just as for alleles submitted through the normal process. We present several potential examples of submission types to ZebraShare including a phenotypic mutants, mildly phenotypic, and early lethal mutants. Mutants for kdm1a show no apparent skeletal phenotype, and phf21aa mutants show only a mild skeletal phenotype, yet these genes have specific human disease relevance and therefore may be useful for further studies. The p120-catenin encoding gene, ctnnd1, was knocked out to investigate a potential role in brain development or function. The homozygous ctnnd1 mutant disintegrates during early somitogenesis and the heterozygote has localized defects, revealing vital roles in early development. Two snu13 genes were knocked out to investigate a role in muscle formation. The snu13a;snu13b double mutant has an early embryonic lethal phenotype, potentially related to a proposed role in the core splicing complex. In each example, the mutants submitted to ZebraShare display phenotypes that are not ideally suited to their originating lab’s project directions but may be of great relevance to other researchers. Conclusion ZebraShare provides an opportunity for researchers to directly share information about mutant lines within ZFIN, which is widely used by the community as a central database of information about zebrafish lines. Submissions of alleles with a phenotypic or unexpected phenotypes is encouraged to promote collaborations, disseminate lines, reduce redundancy of effort and to promote efficient use of time and resources. We anticipate that as submissions to ZebraShare increase, they will help build an ultimately more complete picture of zebrafish genetics and development.

In zebrafish, a subset of hypaxial muscle precursors from the anterior somites undergo long-range migration, moving away from the trunk in three streams to form muscles in distal locations like the fin. We mapped long-distance muscle precursor migrations with unprecedented resolution using live imaging. We identified conserved genes necessary for normal precursor motility (six1a, six1b, six4a, six4b and met). These genes are required for movement away from somites and later to partition two muscles within the fin bud. During normal development, the middle muscle precursor stream initially populates the fin bud, then the remainder of this stream contributes to the posterior hypaxial muscle. When we block fin bud development by impairing retinoic acid synthesis or Fgfr function, the entire stream contributes to the posterior hypaxial muscle indicating that muscle precursors are not committed to the fin during migration. Our findings demonstrate a conserved muscle precursor motility pathway, identify dynamic cell movements that generate posterior hypaxial and fin muscles, and demonstrate flexibility in muscle precursor fates.", "year": 2019, "citation_count": 17, "publisher": "The Company of Biologists"}

In both mouse and zebrafish models, the loss of Nrxn3 results in significantly fewer intact ribbon synapses. We show in zebrafish that, initially, Nrxn3 loss does not alter pre- and postsynapse numbers but, later, synapses fail to pair, leading to postsynapse loss. We also demonstrate that Nrxn3 subtly influences synapse selectivity in zebrafish lateral-line hair cells that detect anterior flow. Loss of Nrxn3 leads to a 60% loss of synapses in zebrafish, which dramatically reduces pre- and postsynaptic responses.

To date, most mechanistic studies have focused on stereocilia bundle morphogenesis, and it remains unclear how this organelle critical for hearing preserves its precise dimensions during life in mammals. The GPSM2–GNAI complex occupies the distal tip of stereocilia in the tallest row and is required for their elongation during development. Here, we ablate GPSM2–GNAI in adult mouse HCs after normal stereocilia elongation is completed. We observe a progressive height reduction of the tallest row stereocilia totaling ~600 nm after 12 wk inGpsm2mutant inner HCs. To measure GPSM2 longevity at tips, we generated aHaloTag-Gpsm2mouse strain and performed pulse–chase experiments in vivo. Estimates using pulse–chase or tracking loss of GPSM2 immunolabeling followingGpsm2inactivation suggest that GPSM2 is relatively long-lived at stereocilia tips with a half-life of 9 to 10 d. Height reduction coincides with dampened auditory brainstem responses evoked by low-frequency stimuli in particular. Finally, GPSM2 is required for normal tip enrichment of elongation complex (EC) partners MYO15A, WHRN, and EPS8, mirroring their established codependence during development. Taken together, our results show that the EC is also essential in mature HCs to ensure precise and stable stereocilia height and for sensitive detection of a full range of sound frequencies.", "year": 2024, "citation_count": 4, "publisher": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"}

In cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs), ribbons play an essential role as core active zone (AZ) organizers, where they tether synaptic vesicles, cluster calcium channels and facilitate the temporally-precise release of primed vesicles. While a multitude of studies aimed to elucidate the molecular composition and function of IHC ribbon synapses, the developmental formation of these signalling complexes remains largely elusive to date. To address this shortcoming, we performed long-term live-cell imaging of fluorescently-labelled ribbon precursors in young postnatal IHCs to track ribbon precursor motion. We show that ribbon precursors utilize the apico-basal microtubular (MT) cytoskeleton for targeted trafficking to the presynapse, in a process reminiscent of slow axonal transport in neurons. During translocation, precursor volume regulation is achieved by highly dynamic structural plasticity – characterized by regularly-occurring fusion and fission events. Pharmacological MT destabilization negatively impacted on precursor translocation and attenuated structural plasticity, whereas genetic disruption of the anterograde molecular motor Kif1a impaired ribbon volume accumulation during developmental maturation.

In the past several years a plethora of papers has indicated a crucial role for primary cilia in the development of a wide variety of organs. We have investigated heart development in cobblestone, a hypomorphic allele of the gene encoding the intraflagellar transport protein Ift88, and uncovered a number of the most common congenital heart defects seen in newborn humans. Methods We generated serial sections of mutant cobblestone and wild type embryos in the region encompassing the heart and the cardiac outflow tract. The sections were further processed to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of these structures, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization were used to examine signal transduction pathways in the relevant areas. Whole mount in situ hybridization was also employed for certain developmental markers. Results In addition to an enlarged pericardium and failure of both ventricular and atrial septum formation, the cobblestone mutants displayed manifold defects in outflow tract formation, including persistent truncus arteriosus, an overriding aorta, and abnormal transformation of the aortic arches. To discern the basis of these anomalies we examined both the maintenance of primary cilia as well as endogenous and migratory embryonic cell populations that contribute to the outflow tract and atrioventricular septa. The colonization of the embryonic heart by cardiac neural crest occurred normally in the cobblestone mutant, as did the expression of Sonic hedgehog. However, with the loss of primary cilia in the mutant hearts, there was a loss of both downstream Sonic hedgehog signaling and of Islet 1 expression in the second heart field, a derivative of the pharyngeal mesoderm. In addition, defects were recorded in development of atrial laterality and ventricular myocardiogenesis. Finally, we observed a reduction in expression of Bmp4 in the outflow tract, and complete loss of expression of both Bmp2 and Bmp4 in the atrioventricular endocardial cushions. Loss of BMP2/4 signaling may result in the observed proliferative defect in the endocardial cushions, which give rise to both the atrioventricular septa as well as to the septation of the outflow tract. Conclusions Taken together, our results potentially identify a novel link between Sonic hedgehog signaling at the primary cilium and BMP-dependent effects upon cardiogenesis. Our data further point to a potential linkage of atrioventricular septal defects, the most common congenital heart defects, to genes of the transport machinery or basal body of the cilia.

Recent research has implicated the RhoA GTPase subfamily in the control of apoptosis in the developing nervous system and in other tissue types. Rho GTPases are important components of the signaling pathways linking extracellular signals to the cytoskeleton. To investigate the role of the RhoA GTPase subfamily in neocortical apoptosis and differentiation, we have engineered a mouse line in which a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19–RhoA) is expressed from theMaptlocus, such that all neurons of the developing nervous system are expressing the N19–RhoA inhibitor. Postnatal expression of N19–RhoA led to no major changes in neocortical anatomy. Six layers of the neocortex developed and barrels (whisker-related neural modules) formed in layer IV. However, the density and absolute number of neurons in the somatosensory cortex increased by 12–26% compared with wild-type littermates. This was not explained by a change in the migration of neurons during the formation of cortical layers but rather by a large decrease in the amount of neuronal apoptosis at postnatal day 5, the developmental maximum of cortical apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of RhoA in cortical neurons was seen to cause high levels of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that RhoA-subfamily members play a major role in developmental apoptosis in postnatal neocortex of the mouse but that decreased apoptosis does not alter cortical cytoarchitecture and patterning.", "year": 2010, "citation_count": 45, "publisher": "Society for Neuroscience"}

Translational control of mRNAs is essential for germ cell differentiation and embryogenesis. Messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes assemble on mRNAs in the nucleus, as they exit via perinuclear germ granules, and in the cytoplasm. Bound messenger ribonucleoproteins including eIF4E exert both positive and negative posttranscriptional regulation. In Caenorhabditiselegans, germ granules are surprisingly dynamic messenger ribonucleoprotein condensates that remodel during development. Two eIF4E paralogs (IFE-1 and IFE-3), their cognate eIF4E–interacting proteins, and polyadenylated mRNAs are present in germ granules. Affinity purification of IFE-1 and IFE-3 messenger ribonucleoproteins allowed mass spectrometry and mRNA-Seq to identify other proteins and the mRNAs that populate stable eukaryotic initiation factor 4E complexes. We find translationally repressed mRNAs (e.g. pos-1, mex-3, spn-4, etc.) enriched with IFE-3, but excluded from IFE-1. Identified mRNAs overlap substantially with mRNAs previously described to be IFE-1 dependent for translation. The findings suggest that oocytes and embryos utilize the 2 eukaryotic initiation factor 4E paralogs for opposite purposes on critically regulated germline mRNAs. Sublocalization within adult perinuclear germ granules suggests an architecture in which Vasa/GLH-1, PGL-1, and the IFEs are stratified, which may facilitate sequential remodeling of messenger ribonucleoproteins leaving the nucleus. Biochemical composition of isolated messenger ribonucleoproteins indicates opposing yet cooperative roles for the 2 eukaryotic initiation factor 4E paralogs.

A yeast-two-hybrid screen using Caenorhabditis elegans GLH-1 as bait identified BYN-1, the homolog of human bystin/BYSL. In humans, bystin promotes cell adhesion and invasion in gliomas, and, with its binding partner trophinin, triggers embryonic implantation into the uterine wall. C. elegans embryos do not implant and lack a homolog of trophinin, but both trophinin and GLH-1 contain unique decapeptide phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat domains. In germ cells, we find endogenous BYN-1 in the nucleolus, partitioned away from cytoplasmic germ granules. However, BYN-1 enters the cytoplasm during spermatogenesis to colocalize with GLH-1. Both proteins become deposited in residual bodies (RBs), which are then engulfed and cleared by the somatic gonad. We show that BYN-1 acts upstream of CED-1 to drive RB engulfment, and that removal of the FG-repeat domains from GLH-1 and GLH-2 can partially phenocopy byn-1 defects in RB clearance.

With its antioxidant properties, butyrate has also been shown to alter the neurological functions in affective disorder models, suggesting it as a key mediator in gut-brain interactions. Objective: Here, we evaluated the negative effect of oxidative stress on the transport of the serotonin precursor tryptophan as present in affective disorders. Butyrate was hypothesized to be able to rescue these deficits due to its antioxidative capacities and its effect on transmembrane transport of tryptophan. Human skin-derived fibroblasts were used as cellular models to address these objectives. Methods: Human fibroblasts were treated with hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress. Stressed as well as control cells were treated with different concentrations of butyrate. Tryptophan (3H) was used as a tracer to measure the transport of tryptophan across the cell membranes (n = 6). Furthermore, gene expression profiles of different amino acid transporters were analyzed (n = 2). Results: As hypothesized,oxidative stress significantly decreased the uptake of tryptophan in fibroblast cells, while butyrate counteracted this effect. Oxidative stress did not alter the gene expression profile of amino acid transporters. However, treatment of stressed and control cells with different concentrations of butyrate differentially regulated the gene expression of large amino acid transporters 1 and 2, which are the major transporters of tryptophan. Conclusions:Gut microbiota-derived butyrate may have therapeutic potential in affective disorders characterized by either aberrant serotonergic activity or neuroinflammation due to its role in rescuing the oxidative stress-induced perturbations of tryptophan transport.

Results and Conclusion: This study demonstrates that proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress decrease the transport of tyrosine (47% and 33%, respectively), which can alter dopamine synthesis.

The amino acid tyrosine is the precursor for synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine, while tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin. A disturbed transport of tyrosine, as well as other amino acids, has been found in a number of other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism, when using the fibroblast cell model. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore whether children with ADHD may have disturbed amino acid transport. Methods Fibroblast cells were cultured from skin biopsies obtained from 14 boys diagnosed with ADHD and from 13 matching boys without a diagnosis of a developmental disorder. Transport of the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan and alanine across the cell membrane was measured by the cluster tray method. The kinetic parameters, maximal transport capacity (V max ) and affinity constant (K m ) were determined. Any difference between the two groups was analyzed by Student's unpaired t-test or the Mann Whitney U test. Results The ADHD group had significantly decreased V max (p = 0.039) and K m (increased affinity) (p = 0.010) of tryptophan transport in comparison to controls. They also had a significantly higher V max of alanine transport (p = 0.031), but the Km of alanine transport did not differ significantly. There were no significant differences in any of the kinetic parameters regarding tyrosine transport in fibroblasts for the ADHD group. Conclusions Tryptophan uses the same transport systems in both fibroblasts and at the blood brain barrier (BBB). Hence, a decreased transport capacity of tryptophan implies that less tryptophan is being transported across the BBB in the ADHD group. This could lead to deficient serotonin access in the brain that might cause disturbances in both the serotonergic and the catecholaminergic neurotransmitter systems, since these systems are highly interconnected. The physiological importance of an elevated transport capacity of alanine to the brain is not known to date.

One explanation may be disturbed transport of tryptophan (precursor for serotonin synthesis) across cell membranes. Human fibroblast cells offer an advantageous model to study the transport of amino acids across cell membranes, since they are easy to propagate and the environmental factors can be controlled. The aim of this study was to functionally characterize tryptophan transport and to identify the main transporters of tryptophan in fibroblast cell lines from healthy controls. Tryptophan kinetic parameters ( Vmax and Km) at low and high concentrations were measured in fibroblasts using the cluster tray method. Uptake of 3H (5)-L-tryptophan at different concentrations in the presence and absence of excess concentrations of inhibitors or combinations of inhibitors of amino acid transporters were also measured. Tryptophan transport at high concentration (0.5 mM) had low affinity and high Vmax and the LAT1 isoform of system-L was responsible for approximately 40% of the total uptake of tryptophan. In comparison, tryptophan transport at low concentration (50 nM) had higher affinity, lower Vmax and approximately 80% of tryptophan uptake was transported by system-L with LAT1 as the major isoform. The uptake of tryptophan at the low concentration was mainly sodium (Na+) dependent, while uptake at high substrate concentration was mainly Na+ independent. A series of different transporter inhibitors had varying inhibitory effects on tryptophan uptake. This study indicates that tryptophan is transported by multiple transporters that are active at different substrate concentrations in human fibroblast cells. The tryptophan transport trough system-L was mainly facilitated by the LAT1 isoform, at both low and high substrate concentrations of tryptophan.

Our data suggest that STING is required for successful functional differentiation of the mammary gland and bestows a differential lactogenic phenotype between #3 mammary glands and the traditionally explored inguinal 4|9 pair. These findings affirm unique development of mammary gland pairs that is essential to consider in future investigations into normal development and breast cancer initiation.", "year": 2024, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "The Company of Biologists"}

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a potent immunostimulatory agonist, triggering pro-inflammatory and type I interferon responses in a host of mammalian cell types. Here we review recent advances in how mtDNA is detected by nucleic acid sensors of the innate immune system upon release into the cytoplasm and extracellular space.

However, the relationships between variations in NADH lifetime and metabolic pathway changes are complex, preventing robust interpretation of NADH lifetime data relative to metabolic phenotypes. Here, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) trained at the cell level with 3D NAD(P)H lifetime decay images (two spatial dimensions and one time dimension) was developed to identify metabolic pathway usage by cancer cells. NADH fluorescence lifetime images of MCF7 breast cancer cells with three isolated metabolic pathways, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and glutaminolysis were obtained by a multiphoton fluorescence lifetime microscope and then segmented into individual cells as the input data for the classification models. The 3D CNN models achieved over 90% accuracy in identifying cancer cells reliant on glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, or glutaminolysis. Furthermore, the model trained with human breast cancer cell data successfully predicted the differences in metabolic phenotypes of macrophages from control and POLG-mutated mice. These results suggest that the integration of autofluorescence lifetime imaging with 3D CNNs enables intracellular spatial patterns of NADH intensity and temporal dynamics of the lifetime decay to discriminate multiple metabolic phenotypes. Furthermore, the use of 3D CNNs to identify metabolic phenotypes from NADH fluorescence lifetime decay images eliminates the need for time- and expertise-demanding exponential decay fitting procedures. In summary, metabolic-prediction CNNs will enable live-cell and in vivo metabolic measurements with single-cell resolution, filling a current gap in metabolic measurement technologies.", "year": 2024, "citation_count": 3, "publisher": "AIP Publishing"}

Disruption of the PS synthase gene CHO1 (i.e., cho1 Δ/Δ) eliminates PS and blocks the de novo pathway for PE biosynthesis. In addition, the cho1 Δ/Δ mutant's ability to cause invasive disease is severely compromised. The cho1 Δ/Δ mutant also exhibits cell wall defects, and in this study, it was determined that loss of PS results in decreased masking of cell wall β(1-3)-glucan from the immune system. In wild-type C. albicans , the outer mannan layer of the wall masks the inner layer of β(1-3)-glucan from exposure and detection by innate immune effector molecules like the C-type signaling lectin Dectin-1, which is found on macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. The cho1 Δ/Δ mutant exhibits increases in exposure of β(1-3)-glucan, which leads to greater binding by Dectin-1 in both yeast and hyphal forms. The unmasking of β(1-3)-glucan also results in increased elicitation of TNF-α from macrophages in a Dectin-1-dependent manner. The role of phospholipids in fungal pathogenesis is an emerging field, and this is the first study showing that loss of PS in C. albicans results in decreased masking of β(1-3)-glucan, which may contribute to our understanding of fungus-host interactions.

However, existing research suggests that farmers and those providing outreach may have different climate change perspectives, and there is little understanding of how farmers prioritize climate change compared with other aspects of their farming system. To compare how farmers and outreach professionals in northern New England consider climate change within the context of whole-farming systems, we conducted mental modeling interviews with 33 farmers and 16 outreach professionals. Despite being primed to consider climate during the interviews, only 24% of farmers and 25% of outreach professionals included climate in their mental models. Key differences arose in both group’s perceptions of weather: outreach professionals focused on connections between good weather and biophysical factors, while farmers drew additional connections to factors like quality of life and overall farm success. Social factors including community well-being, public education, and farm success were significantly more likely to be included (P < 0.05), and in some cases were more influential, in farmer models compared to outreach professional models. We conclude that farmer participants did not perceive climate to be a central factor of their farming systems, and valued human and social dimensions more highly than outreach professionals perceived. These factors may warrant special consideration in efforts to make outreach meaningful to local contexts, along with framing climate change within its broader relationship to other farming system aspects.

Both human mobility and mosquito vector abundances vary seasonally, and the goal of our research was to analyze the interacting effects of disease vector densities and human movement across metapopulations on disease transmission intensity and the probability of super-spreader events. Our research uses the novel approach of combining geographical modeling of mosquito presence with network modeling of human mobility to offer a comprehensive simulation environment for Zika virus epidemics that considers a substantial number of spatial and temporal factors compared to the literature. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that 1) regions with the highest probability of mosquito presence will have more super-spreader events during dry months, when mosquitoes are predicted to be more abundant, 2) regions reliant on tourism industries will have more super-spreader events during wet months, when they are more likely to contribute to network-level pathogen spread due to increased travel. We used the case study of Colombia, a country with a population of about 50 million people, with an annual calendar that can be partitioned into overlapping cycles of wet and dry seasons and peak tourism and off tourism seasons that drive distinct cyclical patterns of mosquito abundance and human movement. Our results show that whether the first infected human was introduced to the network during the wet versus dry season and during the tourism versus off tourism season profoundly affects the severity and trajectory of the epidemic. For example, Zika virus was first detected in Colombia in October of 2015. Had it originated in January, a dry season month with high rates of tourism, it likely could have infected up to 60% more individuals and up to 40% more super-spreader events may have occurred.

The experiments included measuring 30 min of creep and 30 min of creep recovery on the specimens immersed in SW and DW at two different levels of flexural stresses (9% and 14% of the flexural strength) and three temperature values (25, 35, and 45°C). The average creep strain recovery (%) of the specimens was higher for the specimens immersed in SW during testing than the control specimens. The WPC material is considered to have a potential use in structural applications in environments where the temperature is below 45°C because of the following factors: the low deformation under the short-term sustained loading, the decrease in the deformation rate with respect to the increase in load duration, maintaining the modulus of elasticity over a range of temperatures from 25°C to 45°C under sustained load, and the ability to recover more than 69% of the average creep strain under water immersion when the loading source is removed.

This approach bridges site-level observations with biome-scale model estimates to develop a global understanding. Our findings suggest that in boreal and cold temperate regions, temperature primarily constrains the enhancement of the CO2 fertilization on forest GPP; however, warming and higher atmospheric CO2 levels are projected to alleviate these limitations. In tropical forests, CO2 fertilization strongly enhances GPP, but this benefit will be counterbalanced by the adverse impacts of projected climate warming.

However, accurately monitoring landscape changes in the Arctic is challenging due to the complex interactions among permafrost, micro-topography, climate, vegetation, and disturbance. This complexity results in high spatiotemporal variability in permafrost distribution and active layer depth (ALD). Moreover, these key tundra processes interact at different scales, and an observational mismatch can limit our understanding of intrinsic connections and dynamics between above and below-ground processes. Consequently, this could limit our ability to model and anticipate how ALD will respond to climate change and disturbances across tundra ecosystems. In this paper, we studied the fine-scale heterogeneity of ALD and its connections with land surface characteristics across spatial and spectral scales using a combination of ground, unoccupied aerial system, airborne, and satellite observations. We showed that airborne sensors such as AVIRIS-NG and medium-resolution satellite Earth observation systems like Sentinel-2 can capture the average ALD at the landscape scale. We found that the best observational scale for ALD modeling is heavily influenced by the vegetation and landform patterns occurring on the landscape. Landscapes characterized by small-scale permafrost features such as polygon tussock tundra require high-resolution observations to capture the intrinsic connections between permafrost and small-scale land surface and disturbance patterns. Conversely, in landscapes dominated by water tracks and shrubs, permafrost features manifest at a larger scale and our model results indicate the best performance at medium resolution (5 m), outperforming both higher (0.4 m) and lower resolution (10 m) models. This transcends our study to show that permafrost response to climate change may vary across dominant ecosystem types, driven by different above- and below-ground connections and the scales at which these connections are happening. We thus recommend tailoring observational scales based on landforms and characteristics for modeling permafrost distribution, thereby mitigating the influences of spatial-scale mismatches and improving the understanding of vegetation and permafrost changes for the Arctic region.", "year": 2025, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "IOP Publishing"}

The primary objective of this study was to understand the operational characteristics of the loader in a hot operation (handling both sawlog and biomass components concurrently) and cold operation (handling biomass and sawlogs separately) for harvesting sawlogs and biomass. Systematic work sampling techniques were employed to obtain “snapshots” of the loader activities for a cable logging operation, including the interaction of the loader with other operational phases and delay time for both hot and cold configurations. The results show that for hot loading at the landing, the yarder was the most utilized machine (85%), and was the bottleneck of the operation, followed by the loader (70%). In the hot loading configuration, 39% of operational delay during truck loading was caused by the loader and was predominantly due to movement of the loader within or between the landings. This was followed by the yarder (19%, due to rigging activities) and the chaser (15%, to maintain the crews’ safety). In the cold loading configuration, delays due to the unavailability of roll-off bins constituted up to 77% of the operational delay. This suggests that the number of bins and trucks hauling biomass has a crucial role in the overall efficiency of the biomass harvesting system, and should be well balanced with loading capacity.

This method has greater potential to damage advance regeneration than those in which trees are processed at-stump. Hybrid tree-length (Hyb TL) harvesting using an stroke-boom delimber for in-woods processing might be a feasible alternative, but little is known about the production economics of this method. An experimental strip-cutting study was conducted in central Maine, US in the winter of 2018 to: (1) evaluate and compare operational productivity and costs of ground-based Hyb TL and WT methods; (2) identify factors influencing productivity of at-stump and at-landing log processing; and (3) calculate best management practice (BMP) implementation costs in WT harvesting. Time-motion data were recorded for operational phases such as felling, extraction, processing, sorting and loading; machine rates were calculated to determine productivity and costs of operations. Total cost of Hyb TL (US $17.01 m−3) was lower than that of WT ($18.38 m−3). Processing cost was lower at-stump than at-landing ($2.66 and $2.73 m−3 for Hyb TL and WT, respectively). This is likely due to fewer logs handled per cycle at-landing (1.2 logs per turn) compared to the number handled per cycle at-stump (1.4 logs per turn). Sensitivity analysis showed that a 30-m increase in average in-woods distance travelled by the delimber would result in a 41 per cent increase in the processing cost. Cost of BMP implementation in WT was $2.25 m−3 or $59.2 per productive machine hour.

However, for implementing these emerging processes within the woods, several hurdles are to be overcome, among which a balanced supply chain is pivotal. Centralized biomass recovery operation (CBRO) could be an economically viable solution in accessing harvesting sites and allows integration of BCT into forest management. The goal of this study was to examine the logistic effects of integrating a BCT into a CBRO, under different in-wood scenarios based on variations in travel time between the facility locations, amount of raw materials handled, intermediate storage capacity, and duration (number of days) of annual operations. Specific objectives included analyzing the effects of forest residue recoverability (BDMT, bone dry metric ton/ha), total transportation time from the harvest unit to the market, and the annual number of in-woods production sites on the overall efficiency of the BCT operations. Concurrently, this study examined the forest managerial impacts due to such an integration.

Total one-way travel time for all the models ranged between 1.0–1.7 h. Additionally, the annual numbers of BCT sites was inversely proportional to the total one-way travel time (i.e., harvest unit to market). Arranging CBRO and BCT operations to occur at the same in-woods site returned shorter total and average travel times than arranging the two activities at separate in-woods sites.

Logging generates forest residues – low‐quality feedstock – and additional operations that also incur additional costs, such as biomass sorting and treetops processing (BSTP), micro‐chipping, and screening, which are required to improve the feedstock's quality. Considering recent developments in technologies and BSTP to generate high‐quality feedstocks, economic models were developed in this study to estimate various forest‐residue logistics operational costs and to analyze the economics of delivering feedstocks to biomass conversion technology (BCT) sites near woods or power plants located far away in the form of chips, hog fuel, and bales. The results show that the cost of BSTP can vary between $30 and $82/ODMT (oven dry metric ton) based on the biomass sorting intensity. The most economical way to deliver forest residues was transporting processed stem‐wood from landings to near‐wood BCT sites and comminuting it into woodchips there (~$20/ODMT, assuming a one‐way (32 km) road distance and no cost of BSTP at landings). Grinding slash at the landing and transporting ground‐biomass (i.e., hog fuel) to a plant (< 22 km away) was more economical than transporting bales from landings and grinding at the plant. The economic feasibility of baling and BSTP requires a substantial productivity improvement or recognition and incorporation of benefits including reduced wildfire risk and improved forest health. High bulk density and strong shape of forest residues/slash bales compared to hog fuel may provide additional cost benefits during storage, for example through lower handling costs, which can be studied in the future. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "year": 2018, "citation_count": 33, "publisher": "Wiley"}

This annotated bibliography will help practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders gain a better understanding of the existing literature from 2000 to 2015. To this end, we began by classifying the selected literature into six themes: cost, roads and routes, trucking, efficiency & safety, other modes of transportation, and supply chain & optimization. Woody biomass for bioenergy production was the most researched forest product with respect to transportation. About one-third of the articles were presented in the context of supply chain modeling and optimization. More than half of the studies originated from Europe while the United States had the most publications for any given country. The most articles (16) were published in 2013. Biomass and Bioenergy published the highest number of articles (29) during the timeframe.", "year": 2018, "citation_count": 7, "publisher": "MDPI AG"}

The moisture content (MC) of biomass derived from forest residues can pose a challenge to biomass utilization. It plays a significant role in determining the cost of transportation and subsequent market price. Additionally, emerging biomass conversion technologies, such as gasification, torrefaction, and briquetting, have very narrow specifications for the MC (e.g., <15%) in their feedstocks. The goal of this study was to develop strategies for reducing moisture content by evaluating different arrangement patterns of forest residues and its effect on MC reduction at the harvest site. The study compared four different arrangement patterns including criss-cross, teepees, traditional piling (processor piled), and scattered residues in three different timber harvest units in northern California. Two of the arrangement patterns (criss-cross and processor piled) were also covered with a plastic cover. Samples were collected from each treatment using a transect method and were recorded for 12 months. There was an overall drop of MC from 52% (freshly cut) to 12% between all arrangements over the study period. The cost of construction per pile, averaged $37, $41, and $48 for teepees, criss-cross, and processor piles, respectively. Even though, there was no significant difference in MC reduction between piles (except scattered), each pile arrangement of forest residues directly affected biomass feedstock operations, logistics, and costs.

The projected impact spreads all over the world, including New England, USA. Many regions of the world may experience an increase in frequency and severity of drought, which can be attributed to an increased variability in precipitation and enhanced water loss due to warming. The overall benefits of biochar in environmental management have been extensively investigated. This review aims to discuss the water holding capacity of biochar from the points of view of fluid mechanics and propose several prioritized future research topics. To understand the impacts of biochar on sandy soils in-depth, sandy soil properties (surface area, pore size, water properties, and characteristics) and how biochar could improve the soil quality as well as plant growth, development, and yield are reviewed. Incorporating biochar into sandy soils could result in a net increase in the surface area, a stronger hydrophobicity at a lower temperature, and an increase in the micropores to maximize gap spaces. The capability of biochar in reducing fertilizer drainage through increasing water retention can improve crop productivity and reduce the nutrient leaching rate in agricultural practices. To advance research in biochar products and address the impacts of increasing climate variability, future research may focus on the role of biochar in enhancing soil water retention, plant water use efficiency, crop resistance to drought, and crop productivity.", "year": 2021, "citation_count": 102, "publisher": "MDPI AG"}

Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.); SBW) is a native forest pest in the northeastern USA and Canada, including the state of Maine, which defoliates balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and spruce (Picea spp.) trees with cyclical outbreaks every 30-60 years. SBW is typically monitored via ground sampling techniques such as pheromone traps and overwintering second instar larvae (L2) branch sampling. Remote sensing data can also provide information about defoliation patterns across the landscape and forest susceptibility to outbreaks. This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing remote sensing data, ground sampling techniques, and an integrated monitoring approach, combining remote sensing change detection with field sampling. Over a 10-year project period, Sentinel-2 imagery emerged as the most cost-effective option, ranging from US$33 to US$63/square kilometer (sq km), offering wide spatial coverage and moderate resolution suitable for the identification of defoliation patterns. PlanetScope imagery ranged from US$77 to US$241/sq km, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery had the greatest variation, from US$9,220 to US$58,481/sq km. Labor costs are the most influential in our study, ranging from 30% of total costs for remote sensing approaches to 80% for field sampling. The integrated monitoring approach proposed in this study presents a synergistic strategy for effective and timely SBW monitoring, ranging from US$144 to US$213/sq km. Utilizing this integrated approach leverages both remote sensing and L2 branch surveys to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of monitoring efforts, leading to more effective management strategies for mitigating pest outbreaks for landowners.

In particular, the influx of elevated coarse woody material (CWM) following wind disturbance, if left in situ, may impede herbivore access, thereby protecting saplings from browsing damage through a natural ‘exclosure effect’. In 2013, a tornado in northcentral Maine, United States and subsequent salvage logging operations created three clear ‘treatments’ for evaluation of the exclosure effect: blowdown, blowdown plus salvage logging and an undamaged control. Nine years post‐tornado, we inventoried tree regeneration within these treatments to evaluate differences in sapling abundance, species composition, size structure and browsing intensity. We also inventoried CWM, including the height above forest floor. Results revealed significant differences in sapling composition and browsing intensity among treatments. The salvage treatment had the highest proportion of browsed saplings (56 ± 28%; mean ± standard error), followed by the control (9 ± 10%) and blowdown (5 ± 8%). Blowdown had by far the greatest mean (50 ± 9 cm) and average maximum (169 ± 43 cm) heights for CWM. Binomial generalized linear models revealed that browsing probability was a function of mean CWM height and an interaction between sapling density and proportion of sapling hardwoods. Thus, browsing damage was less likely in plots with greater CWM heights and more likely in plots with greater sapling density and more hardwood saplings. Synthesis and applications. This study furthers our understanding of ecosystem recovery following blowdown and salvage logging. Results suggest that salvage logging created important differences in coarse woody material (CWM) abundance and height distribution, when compared to un‐salvaged areas, and that these differences in turn altered sapling size structure and browsing intensity. These findings highlight the potential long‐term effects of successive disturbances, as the differences evident in these early stages may persist for decades or longer. Importantly, we provide evidence of the exclosure effect, suggesting that CWM retained in the un‐salvaged area protected saplings from moose browsing. Thus, in post‐disturbance areas where browsing threatens regeneration, we recommend that managers consider retaining CWM to serve as a natural exclosure.

Because forest canopies create microclimates that preserve snowpack, managing forests to support snow refugia—defined here as areas that remain relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that sustain snow quality, quantity, and/or timing appropriate to the landscape—could reduce climate change impacts on snow cover, sustaining the benefits of snow. We review the current understanding of how forest canopies affect snow, finding that while closed‐conifer forests and snow interactions have been extensively studied in western North America, there are knowledge gaps for deciduous and mixed forests with dormant season leaf loss. We propose that there is an optimal, intermediate zone along a gradient of dormant season canopy cover (DSCC; the proportion of the ground area covered by the canopy during the dormant season), where peak snowpack depth and the potential for snow refugia will be greatest because the canopy‐mediated effects of snowpack sheltering (which can preserve snowpack) outweigh those of snowfall interception (which can limit snowpack). As an initial test of our hypothesis, we leveraged snowpack measurements in the northeastern United States spanning the DSCC gradient (low, <25% DSCC; medium, 25%–50% DSCC; and high, >50% DSCC), including from 2 sites in Old Town, Maine; 12 sites in Acadia National Park, Maine; and 30 sites in the northern White Mountains of New Hampshire. Medium DSCC forests (typically mature mixed coniferous–deciduous forests) exhibited the deepest peak snowpacks, likely due to reduced snowfall interception compared to high DSCC forests and reduced snowpack loss compared to low DSCC forests. Many snow accumulation or snowpack studies focus on the contrast between coniferous and open sites, but our results indicate a need for enhanced focus on mixed canopy sites that could serve as snow refugia. Measurements of snowpack depth and timing across a wider range of forest canopies would advance understanding of canopy–snow interactions, expand the monitoring of changing winters, and support management of forests and snow‐dependent species in the face of climate change.", "year": 2025, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "Wiley"}

Using the contracting weight attached to earnings and cash flows in chief executive officer (CEO) compensation as proxy for the compensation committee’s perception of audit quality, the study examines whether compensation committees perceive performance metric informativeness as being affected by auditor tenure.Design/methodology/approachThe paper regresses CEO cash compensation on accounting-based performance metrics and on interactions between auditor tenure and accounting-based performance metrics while controlling for other factors previously shown to affect CEO pay. Auditor tenure is measured using continuous and dichotomous variables.FindingsAuditor tenure is associated with a reduced (positive) weight on earnings (operating cash flows), which suggests lower perceived audit quality as tenure lengthens consistent with the auditor closeness argument. This relation is asymmetric, i.e. the negative effect of longer auditor tenure on incentive contracting is more pronounced for positive earnings. The results are robust to using CEO total compensation as the compensation measure, as well as using level and change specifications.Research limitations/implicationsThe inability to control for audit partner tenure in assessing the effect of audit firm tenure on incentive contracting and the potential endogeneity between auditor tenure choice and incentive contracting are the main limitations of this study. Given the lack of information on US audit partner tenure, the study could not control for the audit partner tenure issue. However, the study has attempted to mitigate the endogeneity issue by using a Heckman selection model that includes in the first-stage a regression of auditor tenure on various firm, performance measure and CEO-related governance characteristics, based on existing models (Liet al., 2010).Practical implicationsCompensation committees view auditor tenure as an indicator of accounting quality in setting CEO pay. Further, long auditor tenure is perceived as detrimental to financial reporting integrity, particularly when earnings numbers suggest positive managerial performance and innovations.Originality/valueThis study provides empirical evidence that auditor tenure matters in setting executive pay. Further, this study shows evidence on the link between auditor tenure and audit quality from an internal user’s perspective.

{"written_by": "dc90f591-9a0f-42aa-aa9b-5e8b00f74111", "doi": null, "title": "America’s major league soccer: artificial intelligence and the quest to become a world class league", "abstract": " Theoretical basis Resource-based view (RBV) theory (Barney, 1991; Barney and Mackey, 2016; Nagano, 2020) states that a firm’s tangible and intangible resources can represent a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), a long-term competitive advantage that is extremely difficult to duplicate by another firm, when it meets four criteria (i.e. not imitable, are rare, valuable and not substitutable). In the context of this case, we believe there are three sources of SCA to be discussed using RBV – the major league soccer (MLS) team player roster, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to exploit this roster and the league’s single-entity structure: • MLS players: it has been widely acknowledged that a firm’s human resource talent, which includes professional soccer players (Omondi-Ochieng, 2019), can be a source of SCA. For example, from an RBV perspective, a player on the Los Angeles Galaxy roster: > cannot play for any other team in any other league at the same time (not imitable and are rare), > would already be a competitive player, as he is acquired to play in the highest professional league in the country (valuable) and > it would be almost impossible to find a clone player matching his exact talent characteristic (not substitutable) anywhere else. Of course, the roster mix of players must be managed by a capable coach who is able to exploit these resources and win championships (Szymanski et al., 2019). Therefore, it is the strategic human resource or talent management strategies of the professional soccer team roster that will enable a team to have the potential for an SCA (Maqueira et al., 2019). • Technology: technology can also be considered a source of SCA. However, this has been a source of contention. The argument is that technology is accessible to any firm that can afford to purchase it. Logically, any MLS team (or for that matter any professional soccer team) can acquire or build an AI system. For many observers, the only obvious constraint is financial resources. As we discuss in other parts of the case study, there is a fan-based assumption that what transpired in major league baseball (MLB) may repeat in the MLS. The movie Moneyball promoted the use of sabermetrics in baseball when making talent selection (as opposed to relying exclusively on scouts), which has now evolved into the norm of using technology-centered sports analytics across all MLB teams. In short, where is the advantage when every team uses technology for talent management? However, if that is the case, why are the MLB teams continuing to use AI and now the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League are following suit? We believe RBV theorists have already provided early insights: > “the exploitation of physical technology in a firm often involves the use of socially complex firm resources. Several firms may all possess the same physical technology, but only one of these firms may possess the social relations, cultural traditions, etc., to fully exploit this technology to implementing strategies.... and obtain a sustained competitive advantage from exploiting their physical technology more completely than other firms” (Barney, 1991, p. 110). • MLS League Single-Entity Structure: In contrast to other professional soccer leagues, the MLS has one distinct in-built edge – its ownership structure as a single entity, that is as one legal organization. All of the MLS teams are owned by the MLS, but with franchise operators. The centralization of operations provides the MLS with formidable economies of scale such as when investing in AI technologies for teams. Additionally, this ownership structure accords it leverage in negotiations for its inputs such as for player contracts. The MLS is the single employer of all its players, fully paying all salaries except those of the three marquees “designated players.” Collectively, this edge offers the MLS unparalleled fluidity and speed as a league when implementing changes, securing stakeholder buy-ins and adjusting for tailwinds. The “socially complex firm resources” is the unique talent composition of the professional soccer team and most critically its single entity structure. While every team can theoretically purchase an AI technology talent management system, its application entails use across 30 teams with a very different, complex and unique set of player talents. The MLS single-entity structure though is the resource that supplies the stability required for this human-machine (technology) symbioses to be fully accepted by stakeholders such as players and implemented with precision and speed across the entire league. So, there exists the potential for each MLS team (and the MLS as a league) to acquire SCA even when using “generic” AI technology, as long as other complex firm factors come into play. Research methodology This case relied on information that was widely reported within media, press interviews by MLS officials, announcements by various organizations, journal articles and publicly available information on MLS. All of the names and positions, in this case, are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis MLS started as a story of dreaming large and of quixotic adventure. Back in 1990, the founders of the MLS “sold” the league in exchange for the biggest prize in world soccer – the rights to host the 1994 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup before they even wrote up the business plan. Today, the MLS is the highest-level professional men’s soccer league competition in the USA. That is a major achievement in just over 25-years, as the US hosts a large professional sports market. However, MLS has been unable to attract higher broadcasting value for its matches and break into the highest tier of international professional soccer. The key reason is that MLS matches are not deemed high quality content by broadcasters. To achieve higher quality matches requires many inputs such as soccer specific stadiums, growing the fan base, attracting key investors, league integrity and strong governance, all of which MLS has successfully achieved since its inception. However, attracting high quality playing talent is a critical input the MLS does not have because the league has repeatedly cautioned that it cannot afford them yet to ensure long-term financial sustainability. In fact, to guarantee this trade-off, the MLS is one of the only professional soccer leagues with an annual salary cap. So, the question is: how does MLS increase the quality of its matches (content) using relatively low cost (low quality) talent and still be able to demand higher broadcast revenues? One strategy is for the MLS to use AI playing technology to extract higher quality playing performance from its existing talent like other sports leagues have demonstrated, such as the NFL and NBA. To implement such a radical technology-centric strategy with its players requires the MLS to navigate associated issues such as human-machine symbioses, risking fan acceptance and even altering brand valuation.

The theoretical premise is that the practices and decisions of the AFC’s leadership will have a profound impact on the AFC’s performance. However, because the AFC is the continental governing body, the impact is theorized to be far larger, across an entire industry. In writing the case, the authors were guided by upper Echelons theory (UET) (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Hambrick, 2007; Hambrick et al., 2015), which argues that an organization’s strategic direction is directly influenced by its leader’s values. The authors selected UET for the theoretical framework, as it considered a spectrum of factors from industry, leader characters (values), their choices and the results of their actions. Such a comprehensive theory aligned with the complexities of the AFC and its leadership. In constructing the case roadmap using UET, the authors first adopted an ethnographic methodology. This was motivated by the fact that one of the authors had been embedded for many years as part of the leadership team at the AFC. His career work notes based on direct interactions and observations of these leaders helped in two ways: to identify the complex set of personal characteristics of these leaders (i.e. background, their careers outside football and financial standing) as they originated from 47 different nationalities. UET refers to these as observable factors to better theorize the hidden intentions of their alleged corrupt behaviors. UET identifies this second set of non-observable factors as psychological factors. These two different sets of observations combined helped to theorize their drivers, intentions and strategic decisions (options). For the second methodology, the authors accessed archival, publicly available media news and reports to understand the consequences of their actions to the AFC and the Asian football industry. This completed the final parts of the UET framework (Yamak et al., 2014). Research methodology This case relied on information that was widely reported within international media, press announcements by various organizations, published decisions by tribunals and publicly available information on the AFC. All of the names and positions in this case are actual persons. Case overview/synopsis This case focuses on the role and influence of the AFC as the Asian football governing body. The AFC is a member of the world football governing body – FIFA. With a US$1bn budget, the AFC has a strong impact on the future of football among Asia’s three billion people. Unfortunately, the AFC has been unable to create the value in its sports events or properties that attracts fans and investors. Central to this problem is the issue of corruption and corruption allegations within the AFC, especially with regard to its leadership. This case, therefore, attempts to highlight the various issues, discusses the circumstances around these challenges and brings forth the complexities of leading a truly international organization across 47 countries. Such factors are then tied to the value of the organization’s products or services in the marketplace. Complexity academic level The case is written and designed for a graduate level (MBA) class or an upper level undergraduate class such as corporate strategy, leadership, international management, international marketing, contemporary issues in management, cross-cultural management, sports management and sports marketing. In general, the case will also be a good fit for courses that discuss leadership, organizational strategy, organizational structure, organizational ethics and organizational behavior.

The research literature on this topic reinforces this point: the greater part of database systems development projects ends in failure. The use of virtual teams to complete projects further compounds these failures. However, recent developments in intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs), such as Siri, Cortana, or Watson, have created opportunities to automate the systems-development process and improve success rates. Specifically, the use of a virtual assistant possessing key knowledge about database systems development can increase virtual team member technical proficiency in project-based skills. In addition, a virtual assistant can contribute to the development of higher-quality virtual team projects—in this case, database management systems. This observational study found that while the result of statistical analysis was not quite significant, teams that used the IVA did develop higher-quality team projects.", "year": 2017, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "IGI Global"}

This research takes a configural approach to consider how various elements of a participant’s training expectations and their experience in the training condition combine to predict increases in psychological capital.Design/methodology/approachEmployees from hospital settings were randomized into three conditions (mindfulness training, active control (Pilates), and wait-list control group) and completed surveys at three time points (baseline, post-training and three months post-training). A qualitative comparative analysis was applied to see what combinations of motivational elements were associated with increases in psychological capital.FindingsWe find that all three conditions can boost their psychological capital based on different configurations involving efficacy beliefs, baseline states of well-being (psychological capital and perceived stress) and changes in levels of mindfulness and perceived stress.Research limitations/implicationsIndividual characteristics, like motivation, expectancy and baseline needs, are an important consideration in addition to the training condition itself when determining whether a training is efficacious.Practical implicationsIt is of increasing importance that organizations find ways to support employee well-being.

The authors contextualize their theory in the vast and culturally significant entertainment industry sector and contrast the effects between independent films and big budget movies. Design/methodology/approach This study uses an econometric modeling approach. Findings This study finds that unlike new films by well-resourced studios, which must launch in a high season for best performance, independents can generate more revenue in low seasons under certain conditions. The study shows how seasonality moderates the effectiveness of new films’ commercialization strategies and how new product outcomes are different for small independent products than for big-budget productions with regards to distribution duration, advertising expenditure and product characteristics. Research limitations/implications This research extends the literature on launch timing, which examines various strategic tradeoffs. In contrast with the few extant studies whose concern is sensitizing to the effects of seasonality (Siqueiraet al., 2016), this research treats seasonality as an exploitable opportunity that can be strategically factored into business planning for small producers. Accordingly, this is the first study to theoretically and empirically investigate the moderating relationship between seasonality, marketing decisions, product characteristics and performance.

At the same time, there are increasing concerns regarding the cost of higher education and the effectiveness with which universities are using their money. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine changes in higher education productivity over the past 15 years across a sample of more than 500 public universities spanning multiple Carnegie classifications. By utilizing measures generated by a commission of the National Education Council, however, attention is more finely focused on the specific costs and outputs related to instructional activity than previous studies. Design/methodology/approach This research utilizes the recommendations of the National Education Center committee to examine productivity changes in higher education over the past 14 years. To that end, the hypotheses put forth in this research utilize 15 years data of Institutional Primary Education Data, 549 institutions and 3 productivity measures to assess how productivity in higher education has changed between 2002 and 2015. Findings The results of the present research suggest that instructional activity (measured as multifactor productivity) has increased in all Carnegie classifications between 2002 and 2016. Research limitations/implications The present study, organized by Carnegie classification, does not specify the cost of increased instructional productivity. As noted, there are concerns regarding whether at least some of the choices a university might make to increase instructional productivity – such as increased class size and/or an increased use of non-tenure track faculty – could adversely influence the quality of instruction and/or diminish student learning. Further, this research does not examine the relationship between research productivity and increasing instructional productivity. Practical implications The present study does not address the bigger question of whether the increasing costs of higher education are justified, because universities produce much more than student credit hours. While, in an ideal world, these various outputs will complement one another and utilize at least some of the same resources, each has its own unique inputs and associated expenses. Given this, an overall assessment of the value or productivity of a university as a whole is a very difficult thing to determine and is well beyond the scope of a single study. Social implications The present study explicitly focuses on the instructional component of universities and relationship between output and inputs.

In the process, the relationships between executive compensation and financial performance, and corporate social performance and financial performance are examined to determine whether potential compensation and social performance links are coming at the expense of company financial performance.Design/methodology/approachThe empirical data for this research were obtained from a stratified sample of Fortune 1000 companies pulled from across more than 15 industries.

Though an important question for identifying and developing individuals that can perform optimally under such conditions, the behavioral manifestation of perseverance remains understudied. To address this issue, a grounded theory study was conducted in the U.S. Navy's SEAL training course. Before SEALs are able to lead other SEALs, they must first be able to lead themselves. In this training, candidates lead themselves through arguably one of the most difficult military training programs in the country with historical attrition up to 85%. Our research team conducted in-depth interviews with 89 successful candidates from two training classes and found that specific factors such as identity, resilience, humor, and mindset play a role in perseverance in high-stress situations.

Investigating the effects of corporate social responsibility on firm financial performance and employee compensation", "abstract": " Purpose Previous corporate social responsibility (CSR) research often finds conflicting results regarding firm outcomes. This study aims to examine a firm’s relative amount of CSR compared to both peer firms and high CSR firms as one source of those inconsistent findings. Design/methodology/approach This study creates a data set of financial and compensation variables using the Newsweek America’s Most Responsible Companies list (with accompanying ESG scores) and a matched set of firms not recognized for their CSR efforts. Comparisons are made on various firm outcomes between CSR-recognized firms and firms not recognized for their CSR efforts, as well as within recognized firms (using the Newsweek ESG score). Findings Results indicate that while financial performance is higher both for recognized CSR firms (in comparison to non-recognized peers) and for firms with higher ESG scores within recognized CSR firms, compensation results differ. Specifically, CSR recognized firms have higher median employee pay and a lower CEO pay ratio than do non-recognized firms. However, among CSR-recognized firms, higher ESG scores are associated with increased CEO compensation, no relationship to median employee pay and an increased CEO pay ratio. Originality/value The results offer an intriguing explanation for previous mixed results on CSR’s impact on firm outcomes and invite consideration as to whether continued investment in CSR actions once a firm has been recognized for its CSR leads to outcomes in line with the philosophy of CSR.

In this paper, we build on prior literature, which distinguished product from experiential satisfaction to explore the role that knowledge of a prior user plays in shaping these two types of satisfaction in access‐based consumption experiences. Across three studies, we demonstrate that product and experiential satisfaction can be affected differently when consumers are provided with information about previous users of products. We find that information about the previous user of a product consistently negatively impacts product satisfaction. However, we find that when the previous user has positive and experientially relevant traits, experiential satisfaction is increased. When the information about the previous user is negative or experientially irrelevant, experiential satisfaction is decreased. In cases in which we find a positive effect of prior user information on experiential satisfaction, we find it is mediated by transfer of the previous user's traits and that the effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the relevance of traits and the stability of the self‐concept of the consumer.", "year": 2023, "citation_count": 6, "publisher": "Wiley"}

This research uses the choice experiment method to elicit farmers’ preference for production practices and marketing channels in China where e‐commerce and delivery businesses are fast‐growing. Our main finding is that farmers perceive higher utility in selling safer and more eco‐friendly products than conventional products when using e‐commerce platforms, evidence of the online market's positive role in food safety enhancement.

The first synthetic molecular rotor capable of performing repeated 360° rotations due to a combination of photo‐ and thermally activated processes was reported in 1999. The progress in designing different molecular machines in the intervening years has been remarkable, with several outstanding examples appearing in the last few years. Despite the synthetic accomplishments, there remains confusion regarding the fundamental design principles by which the motions of molecules can be controlled, with significant intellectual tension between mechanical and chemical ways of thinking about and describing molecular machines. A thermodynamically consistent analysis of the kinetics of several molecular rotors and pumps shows that while light driven rotors operate by a power‐stroke mechanism, kinetic asymmetry—the relative heights of energy barriers—is the sole determinant of the directionality of catalysis driven machines. Power‐strokes—the relative depths of energy wells—play no role whatsoever in determining the sign of the directionality.

We include a general introduction to the field and describe the emerging magneto-optical effects in magnetoplasmonic and magnetophotonic nanostructures supporting localized and propagating plasmons. Special attention is given to magnetoplasmonic crystals with transverse magnetization and the associated nanophotonic non-reciprocal effects and to magneto-optical effects in periodic arrays of nanostructures. We also give an overview of the applications of these systems in biological and chemical sensing, as well as in light polarization and phase control. We further review the area of nonlinear magnetophotonics, the semiconductor spin-plasmonics, and the general principles and applications of opto-magnetism and nano-optical ultrafast control of magnetism and spintronics.", "year": 2020, "citation_count": 115, "publisher": "AIP Publishing"}

The spontaneously formed stripe domains are used as a field-controlled optical grating, allowing for active spatiotemporal control of light. We discuss the basic ideas behind the approach and provide a quantitative description of the field dependence of the obtained light patterns. Finally, we calculate and experimentally verify the efficiency of our magneto-optical grating.", "year": 2022, "citation_count": 1, "publisher": "AIP Publishing"}

Focused on the dissemination of a constantly changing set of attention-grabbing songs, leading companies dramatically expanded the market for popular compositions, generating hits that sold millions of copies of sheet music to customers across the country. While publishers aimed at this continental audience, their output was shaped by the urban context in which their businesses first emerged. During these years, local popularity was crucial to national success. As a result, firms sought to engage with new audiences throughout Manhattan, incorporating a host of social and ethnic groups into the structures of commercial entertainment. Over time, Tin Pan Alley’s relationship to these groups—and the distinctive leisure spaces in which they gathered—would define its musical production. It was not simply that publishers molded songs to fit public taste. Rather, the industry and the broader world of commercial entertainment developed together. By exploring this business-influenced process of cultural change, it is possible to gain new perspective on the emergence of American popular song, as well as the consumption-driven dynamics remaking society in the Progressive Era in the United States.", "year": 2023, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press (CUP)"}

This article explores the benefits of considering sonic evidence alongside a host of other material; teaching and writing histories with—rather than of—sound. In the classroom, this kind of “history with sound” is particularly useful for its ability to cut across lines of scholarly inquiry. This makes sound an especially potent resource when teaching the history of the United States during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. During these years, American society underwent a many-sided process of development difficult to adequately narrativize. The study of sound, with its ability to link numerous trends and dynamics within densely layered events, can help address this issue. Providing insight into the practices and problems of everyday life, such sonic history can reveal the interplay of change and continuity that defined the social experience of the turn-of-the-century United States. Focused on sound in New York, this article provides an overview of the topic’s historiography before examining a series of distinct case studies for classroom use.", "year": 2023, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press (CUP)"}

Operating before the rise of mechanically reproduced entertainment, its centralized booking offices moved tens of thousands of performers across hundreds of stages to an audience of millions. Designed to gather and analyze data about both audiences and performers, these offices created a complex informational economy that defined the genre—an internal market that sought to transform culture into a commodity. By reconstructing the concrete details of these business practices, it is possible to develop a new understanding of both the success of the vaudeville industry and its influence on the evolution of American mass culture.", "year": 2021, "citation_count": 0, "publisher": "Cambridge University Press (CUP)"}

Toynbee. It centers on early twentieth-century British social thought and its synthesis of idealism and evolution. Toynbee used this framework to interpret imperial and international affairs, and, like his mentors, he focused especially on the unprecedented, progressive possibilities of global integration. With the failure of the Paris Peace Conference, however, Toynbee began to regard globalization as a contradiction between social unity and spiritual disjuncture. A Study of History , his endeavor to bring historical writing into its global present, followed from this opposition, which he sought to explain and hoped to resolve. By the mid 1930s, world events finally overwhelmed Toynbee's commitment to the old conceptual synthesis. He returned to such thinking after World War II, but his brief declaration of methodological limitations illuminated for historical study the antinomy of the global scale.", "year": 2012, "citation_count": 8, "publisher": "Project MUSE"}

It analyses how it intersected with the moral contours of pillage as revealed in the actions and attitudes of British soldiers, British commanders, and Boer civilians during the South African War. In doing so, it crosses from ideal moral theory to international law, to shared and disputed moral beliefs among participants in the South African War. Drawing from pillage in the South African War, it concludes that the motives, policing, and moral and political context of pillage are vital to understanding its historical significance.
