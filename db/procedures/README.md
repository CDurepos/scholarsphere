# ScholarSphere Procedures

This directory contains all `*.sql` scripts for procedures of the ScholarSphere application.

## Naming Conventions

In each script, we utilize variable prefixes to clarify their role and to avoid naming collisions within the DB.

`v_` is used to signify a local variable.

`p_` is used to signify a parameter.
